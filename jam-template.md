<h1><img class="ui avatar image" src="/images/july4.jpg">Wave That Flag</h1>

Kevin and Heidi invite us to their 4th of July pool party and jam session!  He just bought a 10' inflatable pool for kids (of all ages) along with water pistols, balloons, and other instruments of mayhem.  A keg of Sierra Nevada and open grill will get the potluck going.

Party starts at 4pm with bluegrass music hosted by Kilin Reece.  Kevin requests an electric HSJ set between 6:00pm and 7:30pm.  After that, break for food and a walk down to Kailua Beach for the fireworks. Short set after 9pm to round out the evening. 
 
Setlist? We don't need no stinkin' setlist. Let's cherry pick some stuff [we've played before](/setlists).

Notes:

 * Due to the relatively short notice for this jam, and the fact that I am out of town until just a few days before, the setlist stays away from double black diamond tunes.  To provide familiarity without burnout, the initial selections are tunes [we've played before](setlists.html) but no more than three times. (Except for Jack Straw, Joanne's favorite tune.) If you have suggestions, please feel free to make them!

 * Kevin R: we will have the Nord keyboard ready for you!  Please feel free to bring your electric guitar, mando, and amp as well if you like.
 
 *  We are continuing our exploration of "No PA jamming" this month, even though this is an electric jam. So, please bring your amp. Kevin H. and I are trying to figure out how to use small acoustic amps for vocal amplification so Kevin doesn't have to schlep the full PA.
