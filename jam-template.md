<h1><img class="ui avatar image" src="/images/july4.jpg">Wave That Flag</h1>

Kevin and Heidi invite us to their 4th of July pool party and jam session!  He just bought a 10' inflatable pool for kids (of all ages) along with water pistols, balloons, and other instruments of mayhem.  A keg of Sierra Nevada and open grill will get the potluck going.

Party starts at 4pm with bluegrass music hosted by Kilin Reece.  Kevin requests an electric HSJ set between 6:00pm and 7:30pm.  After that, break for food and a walk down to Kailua Beach for the fireworks. Short set after 9pm to round out the evening. 
 
Setlist? We don't need no stinkin' setlist. Let's cherry pick some stuff [we've played before](/setlists).

Agenda for the October 2017 Hardly Strictly Jerry Jam:

  * Host: Philip Johnson

  * Startup Setlist: Cassidy, China/Rider, Deal, He's Gone, Jack Straw, Loser, New Speedway Boogie, Women are smarter, Mission in the Rain, Mississippi Half-Step, Ramble on Rose, West LA Fadeaway. 
  
Notes:

 * Due to the relatively short notice for this jam, and the fact that I am out of town until just a few days before, the setlist stays away from double black diamond tunes.  To provide familiarity without burnout, the initial selections are tunes [we've played before](setlists.html) but no more than three times. (Except for Jack Straw, Joanne's favorite tune.) If you have suggestions, please feel free to make them!

 * Kevin R: we will have the Nord keyboard ready for you!  Please feel free to bring your electric guitar, mando, and amp as well if you like.
 
 *  We are continuing our exploration of "No PA jamming" this month, even though this is an electric jam. So, please bring your amp. Kevin H. and I are trying to figure out how to use small acoustic amps for vocal amplification so Kevin doesn't have to schlep the full PA.

<h2>Directions to Paul's Studio</h2>

In a nutshell, you will:

  * Temporarily park in an alley just a few steps from the studio entrance for load-in/load-out.
  * Call Paul at [808-228-6066‬](tel:808-228-6066‬) when you have parked in alley and are about to drop off equipment. Studio is on second floor so you will probably drop off equipment on ground floor with someone to watch it, then repark car.
  * Park in public parking a block away during the jam.
