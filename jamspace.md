## Others

* Michael and Justin visited Thunder Studios Hawaii (https://www.thunderstudiohawaii.com/) and found the area only appropriate for daylight hour jams. 


## In case you want to do additional research

Here's the template email I used to gather information:

Greetings,

My name is Philip Johnson, and I am a member of a local jam band called Hardly Strictly Jerry.  We are looking for a rehearsal space to rent for an evening approximately once or twice a month starting in January.  I wanted to inquire about your space.  Here's our situation:

* 3 guitarists (all vocalists)
* 1 keyboard player
* 1 bass player
* 1 drummer (also vocalist)
* 1 percussion player (congas)

So, here's our questions:

(1) What is the size of your rehearsal space? (For seven people we probably need around 400 sq ft)

(2) What is provided? In an ideal world, we would love to have access to:
  - 4 mics + mic stands
  - 3 guitar amps
  - 1 bass amp
  - keyboards (nord, yamaha) + amp
  - 1 drum kit
  - 1 set congas
  - PA for vocals and rough mix recording just for reference purpose

But we don't expect everything. What subset can you provide?

(3) What is the hourly charge?

(4) What is the parking situation?

(5) Anything else we should know?

Thanks for providing us with this information!

Philip
