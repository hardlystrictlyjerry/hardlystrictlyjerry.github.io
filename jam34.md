## Rehearsal schedule

Here is a summary of availability to rehearse:

<img class="ui centered fluid image" src="/images/22-12-09-rehearsal-availability.png">

The red X's indicate a date when someone is unavailable. 

Rehearsal proposal, working backwards:
  * Tue 12/6 or Wed 12/7, (with Steve). 6-9pm. Location: Steve's or West One?
  * Sat 12/3 or Sun 12/4, (with Steve). 1-4 or 2-5pm? Location: MS or KH?
  * Tue 11/22 or Sun 11/20. Afternoon or evening, depending. 
  * Mon 11/14.  6-8pm. Location: MS?

## Next rehearsal

* Tuesday, Nov 8, 6pm - 8pm, Michael Shapiro's house. 
* Six songs: Jack Straw, Tennessee Jed, Sugaree, Cassidy, Alabama Getaway, Ramble on rose

Prepare if you want, don't prepare if you don't want.  No one cares if you don't prepare.

## We got (the potential for) merch!

I couldn't help myself---I contacted another graphic artist to have a go at the HSJ logo.  He just came back with:

* A bumper sticker design
* A laptop sticker design
* A single color tshirt design.

Check it out here:

There are two small issues I've already noticed:

1. The bumpersticker has a misspelling ('stricktly').
2. The fishman bear looks a bit bigger than the other ones. 

Otherwise I think these are super cool (notice the lightning bolt going through a donut?)

I want to get back to the artist soon with any modifications, so please take a look and LMK.

I'm thinking a merch table at the Dec 9 gig. We can take pre-orders using the HSJ mailing list!

This doesn't have to be the "official" or "final" HSJ logo or anything like that.  It could simply be the "2022" HSJ design. If someone is inspired to do something different, we can pursue that in 2023 or whenever. I just want to have stickers to pass out at Phish NYE!
