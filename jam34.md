With Steve Howells pinch-hitting at the drum kit, HSJ played its second Honolulu Dead Night. The place was packed, the joint was jumpin', and it seems a great time was had by all. 

First Set: Cold Rain and Snow, Sugaree, Cassidy->Jack Straw, Alabama Getaway, Tennessee Jed, China->Rider, Lonesome and a Long Way from Home.

Second Set: Big Railroad Blues, New Speedway Boogie, Candyman, Ramble On Rose, West LA Fadeaway, Sugar Magnolia->Scarlet->Fire->Sunshine Daydream

Encore: Blaze On, Casey Jones. 

I know, I know: China->Rider and Scarlet->Fire in the same show? Turns out the Dead actually did it 40 years ago to the day on [12-09-81](https://archive.org/details/gd81-12-09.sbd.clugston.13061.sbeok.shnf). 

Not to say we always need historical approval: our encore started with Blaze On, for our first performance Phish tune. The crowd (at least the ones in front) appeared to be delighted. Now we actually live up to our name! 

Speaking of Phish/Dead combinations, this show premiered our first HSJ swag:
