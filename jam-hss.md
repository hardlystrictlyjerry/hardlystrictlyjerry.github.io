John Stallings invites the HSJ crew to participate in a BBQ and jam session on Saturday, February 4, 2017 on [112 S. Kalaheo Ave, Kailua, HI 96734](http://maps.google.com/?q=112%20S.%20Kalaheo%20Ave,%20Kailua,%20HI%2096734). Eat, drink, and get merry from 5-6pm, jam from 6-8pm. 

Here's what you need to know and do:

* Click [here](https://goo.gl/qjs29A) to see the invitation.

* Click [here](https://goo.gl/3CxNlT) to RSVP. John needs a headcount so he can prepare enough food. You can bring your friends!

Finally, I am helping Doug Dirt of the Banana Slug String Band to organize the jam. John has invited other musicians in addition to HSJ.  Doug and I hope to create an online list of songs people want to play and what instruments they want to play on them.  We hope this approach will naturally result in small ensembles for "mini-sets" of a few songs and avoid eight guitarists on stage, only four of whom know the tune.
  
So, please click [here](https://goo.gl/88Q5rU) to access the online list of songs. Anyone can edit it. Please update with new songs you want to add, or existing songs you want to play on.  Please check back every so often to see the updated set list.
