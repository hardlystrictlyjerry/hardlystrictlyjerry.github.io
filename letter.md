<h1><img class="ui avatar image" src="/images/jerryavatar.jpg">Whither HSJ?</h1>

Hi everyone, 

When I started HSJ three years ago, there were several organizing principles:

 * No rehearsals, just get together and play.
 * The host specifies the setlist (All dance tunes? No problem!)
 * HSJ is not a "band", it's a "jam".
 * Low stress, no drama.
 
During 2019, this initial approach (let's call it HSJ-Jam) has evolved into a more traditional "band" structure (let's call it HSJ-Band). Now we get together only to rehearse or to perform (doing anything else is "squandering" time); there is push-back about the host having any input into the setlist; we have significant setup and tear-down costs (tent, drum riser, lights); and we plan multi-hour, multi-set, highly structured and rehearsed performances.

There's nothing wrong with HSJ-Band, but its current manifestation is just not my jam. Perhaps it's time for us to explicitly acknowledge these two formats and allow people to opt-in or opt-out as they like, without pressure or recriminations. I don't have any desire to play at Anna's, never did actually, but went along with it simply to be a good sport. Now it's reached a point where I kinda feel like opting-out entirely.  But that's just me: I can imagine that others might be excited by this opportunity to take HSJ-Band to the next level of musical quality. (One man gathers what another man spills.)

Carlie and Phil's October party, on the other hand, has the potential to be organized as an HSJ-Jam.  For example, we could allow Carlie and Phil extensive input on the setlist (which, I assume, would mean Paul would opt-out).  If we wanted, we could organize it as an acoustic jam on their porch and not set up a tent or a drum riser or lights. We could decide to make it super easy, super low stress, and we might enjoy 80% of the fun with 10% of the effort.  Or, we could continue to plan another HSJ-Band performance, with all that this implies.

One can imagine hybrids (HSJ-JamBand?). But it's important, at least for me, to be thoughtful about the nature of our musical collaboration. I'm not trying to argue that HSJ-Jam is better than HSJ-Band or vice versa.  My hope is to simply make this issue explicit and enable everyone to think about which forms of HSJ they want to participate in and which forms they don't in a friendly and supportive manner.
