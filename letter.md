<h1><img class="ui avatar image" src="/images/jerryavatar.jpg">Whither HSJ?</h1>

Hi everyone, 

When I started HSJ three years ago, there were several organizing principles:

 * No rehearsals, just get together and play.
 * The host specifies the format of the jam and the setlist (All dance tunes? No problem!)
 * HSJ is not a "band", it's a "jam".
 * Low stress, no drama.
 
During 2019, this initial approach (let's call it HSJ-Jam) has evolved into a more traditional "band" structure (let's call it HSJ-Band). Now we get together only to rehearse or to perform (doing anything else is "squandering" time); there is push-back about the host having any input into the setlist; we have significant setup and tear-down costs (tent, drum riser, lights); and we plan multi-hour, multi-set, highly structured and rehearsed performances.

There's nothing wrong with HSJ-Band, but its current manifestation is just not my jam. Perhaps it's time for us to explicitly acknowledge these two formats and allow people to opt-in or opt-out as they like, without pressure or recriminations. I don't have any desire to play at Anna's, never did actually, but went along with it simply to be a good sport. Now it's reached a point where I kinda feel like opting-out entirely.  But that's just me: I can imagine that others might be excited by this opportunity to take HSJ-Band to the next level of musical quality. (One man gathers what another man spills.)

Carlie and Phil's October party, on the other hand, has the potential to be organized as an HSJ-Jam.  For example, we could allow Carlie and Phil extensive input on the setlist (which might mean Paul would opt-out).  If we wanted, we could organize it as an acoustic jam on their porch and not set up a tent or a drum riser or lights. We could decide to make it super easy, super low stress, and we might enjoy 80% of the fun with 10% of the effort.  Or, we could continue to plan another HSJ-Band performance, with all that this implies.

One can imagine hybrids (HSJ-JamBand?). But it's important, at least for me, to become more explicit about the nature of our musical collaboration, since not all formats work for everyone.  

I think a simple way forward is to return to the "hosting" model, whereby whoever is selected as host has final say over the approach to their event. I think if we had determined the "host" for the Anna's gig early on, and agreed to respect their final decision on structure and content, much of the confusion of recent days could have been avoided. Similarly, if Carlie and Phil are selected as hosts for the October event, then that gives them authority.  People always have the right to opt-out if an event is not to their liking, but at least this way we aren't locking HSJ into single way of being. 

What do you think about this?
