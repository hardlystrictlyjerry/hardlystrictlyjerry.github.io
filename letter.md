<h1><img class="ui avatar image" src="/images/jerryavatar.jpg">Whither HSJ?</h1>

Hi everyone, 

When I started HSJ three years ago, there were several organizing principles:

 * No rehearsals, just get together and play.
 * The host specifies the setlist (All dance tunes? No problem!)
 * HSJ is not a "band", it's a "jam".
 * Low stress, no drama.
 
During 2019, this initial approach (let's call it HSJ-Jam) has evolved into a more traditional "band" structure (let's call it HSJ-Band). Now we get together only to rehearse or to perform (doing anything else is "squandering" time); there are negative feelings about the host having any input into the setlist; we have significant setup costs (tent, drum riser, lights); and we focus on multi-hour, multi-set, highly structured and rehearsed performances.

There's nothing wrong with HSJ-Band, but its current manifestation is just not my jam. I am wondering if it's time for us to explicitly acknowledge these two formats and allow people to opt-in or opt-out as they like, without pressure or recriminations. I don't have any desire to play at Anna's, never did actually, but was going along with it simply to be a good sport. Now the drama has reached a point where I kinda feel like opting-out of the gig entirely.

Carlie and Phil's October party, on the other hand, could be an opportunity to have an HSJ-Jam.  For example, we could allow Carlie and Phil extensive input on the setlist (which, I assume, would mean Paul would opt-out).  If we wanted, we could organize it as an acoustic jam on their porch and not set up a tent or a drum riser or lights. We could decide to make it super easy, super low stress, and we might enjoy 80% of the fun with 10% of the effort.  Or, we could continue on our current path and prepare another HSJ-Band performance, with all that this implies. Or something in between.

One can imagine hybrids (HSJ-JamBand?). But it's important, at least for me, to be thoughtful about the nature of our musical collaboration. Not every form of HSJ works for me, but some do. My hope in writing this is to make these issues explicit and allow everyone to choose which forms of HSJ they want to participate in and which forms they don't want in a friendly and supportive manner.
