<h1><img class="ui avatar image" src="/images/jerryavatar.jpg">July 2016</h1>

Many thanks to Kevin and Heidi for hosting the July HSJ Jam: opening their house, making delicious food (thanks Heidi!), setting up the PA after setting up and tearing down the PA earlier that day (thanks Kevin!)
 
Songs: Bertha, Eyes of the World, Bird Song, Man Smart/Women Smarter, They Love Each Other, Brown Eyed Women, Don't Let Go, Franklin's Tower, Sugaree, Uncle John's Band, The Wheel, Dire Wolf, Big River, and probably a few others I've forgotten.
