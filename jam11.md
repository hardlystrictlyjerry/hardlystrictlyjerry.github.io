Notes:

 * Due to the relatively short notice for this jam, and the fact that I am out of town until just a few days before, the setlist stays away from double black diamond tunes.  To provide familiarity without burnout, the initial selections are tunes [we've played before](setlists.html) but no more than three times. (Except for Jack Straw, Joanne's favorite tune.) If you have suggestions, please feel free to make them!

 * Kevin R: we will have the Nord keyboard ready for you!  Please feel free to bring your electric guitar, mando, and amp as well if you like.
 
 *  We are continuing our exploration of "No PA jamming" this month, even though this is an electric jam. So, please bring your amp. Kevin H. and I are trying to figure out how to use small acoustic amps for vocal amplification so Kevin doesn't have to schlep the full PA.
