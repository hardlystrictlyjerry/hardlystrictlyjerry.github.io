Kevin and Heidi invite us to their 4th of July pool party and jam session!  He just bought a 10' inflatable pool for kids (of all ages) along with water pistols, balloons, and other instruments of mayhem.  A keg of Sierra Nevada and open grill will get the potluck going.

Party starts at 4pm with bluegrass music hosted by Kilin Reece.  Kevin requests an electric HSJ set between 6:00pm and 7:30pm.  After that, break for food and a walk down to Kailua Beach for the fireworks. Short set after 9pm to round out the evening.
