# Friends of Hardly Strictly Jerry

A friend of Kevin's came up to me at his last party and said, *"I'd really like to come hear you guys play.  This is my favorite music, and I so rarely get to hear it played live anymore.*"

And so, I'd like to propose "Friends of Hardly Strictly Jerry" (FoHSJ), a curated mailing list that we can use to invite the truly deadicated to our jams. 
 
Here's my proposed ground rules:

  1. Any HSJ musician can request additions to the list. Please provide name, email, and phone if possible.

  2. Any HSJ musician can veto any proposed addition to the FoHSJ mailing list.
  
  3. Each monthly host can "opt-in" to inviting FoHSJ.  If you want to limit it to musicians only, that's fine.
  
  4. The email list will be kept as a contact list in the hardlystrictlyjerry@gmail.com account.  There is no public access. Only Philip can send emails to the list. 
  
  5. If the host opts-in, then Philip will send an email to the FoHSJ list providing a link to the invite page. Any FoHSJ will be asked to RSVP to the host to let them know that they are coming and how many folks they'd like to bring with them. 
  
Here is the proposed initial membership of FoHSJ:
