# Friends of Hardly Strictly Jerry

A friend of Kevin's came up to me at his last party and said, *"I'd really like to come hear you guys play.  This is my favorite music, and I so rarely get to hear it played live anymore.*" I've had a few other folks express a similar sincere desire to attend our future jams.

And so, I'd like to propose "Friends of Hardly Strictly Jerry" (FoHSJ), a curated mailing list that we can use to invite the truly deadicated to our jams.  The goal is not to create a massive party every time, but to make HSJ accessible to the very small community of local deadheads.
 
Here's my proposed ground rules:

  1. Any HSJ musician can request additions to the list. Please provide name, email, and phone if possible.

  2. Any HSJ musician can veto any proposed addition to the FoHSJ mailing list. HSJ is first and foremost for the musicians. 
  
  3. Each monthly host can "opt-in" to inviting FoHSJ.  If you want to limit it to musicians only, that's fine.
  
  4. The FoHSJ list will be managed as a contact list in the hardlystrictlyjerry@gmail.com account.  There will be no public access. Philip will be responsible for sending out the emails. The table at the bottom of this page will be kept up to date, so hosts can review it before deciding whether or not to opt-in to inviting FoHSJ.
  
  5. If the host opts-in, then Philip will send an email to the FoHSJ list providing a link to the invite page. Any FoHSJ will be asked to RSVP to the host to let them know that they are coming and how many folks they'd like to bring with them. 
  
Here is the proposed initial membership of FoHSJ; if you have others to add, please contact Philip.
