Paul Perrone invites the HSJ family and friends to a pre and post Phil and Friends jam at his studio.
 
*Where:* 1154 Fort Street Mall. Standing on the mall facing the building, you'll see a large open entrance area blocked by a gate of black bars. Call Paul at <a href="tel:808-228-6066">808-228-6066</a> when you get there and he will come down to let you in.  

Here's an old picture of the entrance with the gates open:

*When:* Doors for Phil open at 8pm. So maybe sometime after 6pm? Post-show nightcap also a possibility.

*What:* Back line provided. Bring instruments and party materials. Small fridge available but it's recommended that you bring a small cooler.
