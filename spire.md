This page provides information on how we can jam together using Spire.

**1. Download Spire app.**

First, download the free [Spire app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spire-music-recorder-studio/id1013021109). You need an iOS device (iPhone or iPad) for this link.  I will refer to "iPhone" in the remainder of these instructions, but iPads are just the same.

There may be an Android version available too.

**2. Download a copy of an HSJ Spire "project" (song).**

Second, once the app is installed, you should be able to open it on your phone by clicking the link in the text message.

This will download a copy of the project to your phone. If you accidentally delete all the tracks or something, you can recover by deleting the project and downloading a new copy. Nothing you do on your phone will affect the Spire projects in the cloud.

**3. Record additional tracks on your Spire Project copy.**

Once you have a local copy of your project open, you are ready to record new tracks.  Here are some hints:

You will need to position your iPhone's microphone near your sound source. You will also need to plug in headphones to your iPhone so you can monitor the previously recorded tracks while you add your own. Resist the temptation to use bluetooth headphones like EarPods: I bought a pair just for this and bluetooth introduces an unacceptable lag. Wired earbuds have worked fine for me.

I've used amplification for all my tracks: Fishman LoudBox for acoustic guitar and vocals, Fender Princeton Reverb for electric guitar. I place my iPhone about two inches from the amp.  I suspect this is not necessary and you can just record straight from your instrument/voice into the iPhone mic if you prefer.

Once you have everything positioned, click on the left side of the track bar to reveal the "Soundcheck" icon. After clicking, it asks you to play (or sing) and the identifies what the sound source is (guitar, bass, vocals, keys, etc) and applies appropriate levels and EQ.  Amaze Balls!

Now you are ready to record.  Press the red button and let 'er rip.  If you don't like it, you can click on the right side of the track bar to reveal a menu that lets you delete the track.

After you've recorded a track you like, press the "Mix" button to go to a page where you can move your track forward or backward or left or right in the mix.

There's not much documentation, and fortunately the app is so simple that you don't need much, but here's a page from the manufacturer that I found very useful at the beginning: [Getting the most out of the free Spire app](https://www.izotope.com/en/learn/getting-the-most-out-of-the-free-spire-ios-app.html).

**4. Make a video (optional but recommended).**

For extra fun, use some other device with a camera to record yourself while you're doing the track, or even after you've finished where you pretend to play/sing along with the track.

Send me your video file somehow and I will update the YouTube video with your clip!

**5. Share your new Spire Project.**

When you're ready to share your local Spire Project, please do the following:

First, it's helpful to rename your copy of the original Spire project.  So, for example, if you're Michael and you downloaded the Spire Project called "Sisters and Brothers", you could rename it to "Sisters and Brothers (MS)".  To rename a project, just click on the project name and it will bring up an edit pane.

Second, click on the "Upload" icon at the top left of the screen, then click on "Spire Project", then "Share via link". Then text the link to me (or whoever).

*Important!!!* After texting the link, you need to keep the Spire app open for a few minutes!  This is because when you click "Share via link", it starts uploading your tracks silently in the background.  If you quit the app immediately, then the upload will be interrupted and when others try to download your new Spire Project, there will be an error ("Oops! Project was unable to be shared.")

**FAQ: But what happens with more than two musicians?**

So, the alert reader might be asking: what happens if two musicians download the same "base" Spire Project and add their tracks independently? How do we "merge" these independently updated Spire Projects?

The answer, as far as I can tell, is that you can't simply "merge" two Projects, but you can export tracks as .wav files. These can be imported into GarageBand (or any other DAW you have around).

So, if a bunch of us edit the same base Project, I will export all the tracks and provide links to them here so you can create a "merged" version in GarageBand. (I could also create a pre-mixed wav file with all the individual tracks in a new project).

Another option is "round robin", where we sequentially work on a single Spire project and "pass it around" to each person in turn. That could also work well once we all get comfortable with the process and decide this is a fun activity.
