This page provides access to all my Spire music projects and their current status.

## How to play along

If you'd like to add a track, here's the basic process:

First, download the free [Spire app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spire-music-recorder-studio/id1013021109). You need an iOS device (iPhone or iPad).  I will refer to "iPhone" in the remainder of these instructions, but iPads are just the same.

Second, once the app is installed, navigate to this page using a browser on your iPhone and click on one of the "Spire Project" links below. Hopefully, it will ask you if you want to open the link in the Spire app. You want to say Yes. (If this doesn't happen, let me know so I can update these instructions).

Third, once you have the project open, you are ready to record your track.  Here are some hints:

  * You will need to position your iPhone's microphone near your sound source. You will also need to plug in headphones to your iPhone so you can monitor the previously recorded tracks while you add your own. Resist the temptation to use bluetooth headphones like a EarPod: I bought a pair just for this and they introduce an unacceptable lag. Wired earbuds have worked fine for me.

  * I've used amplification for all my tracks: Fishman LoudBox for acoustic guitar and vocals, Fender Princeton Reverb for electric guitar. I place my iPhone about two inches from the amp.  I suspect this is not necessary and you can just record straight from your instrument/voice into the iPhone mic if you prefer.

  * Once you have everything positioned, click on the left side of the track bar to reveal the "Soundcheck" icon. After clicking, it asks you to play (or sing) and the identifies what the sound source is (guitar, bass, vocals, keys, etc) and applies appropriate levels and EQ.  Amaze Balls!

  * Now you are ready to record.  Press the red button and let 'er rip.  If you don't like it, you can click on the right side of the track bar to reveal a menu that lets you delete the track.

  * After you've recorded a track you like, press the "Mix" button to go to a page where you can move your track forward or backward or left or right in the mix.

  * When you're happy, or (if you're like me) only moderately embarrassed, then you can click the "Upload" icon at the top left of the screen. Click on "Spire Project", then "Share via link" to text a link to the project to me (or whomever).

For extra fun, use some other device with a camera to record yourself while you're doing the track, or even after you've finished where you pretend to play/sing along with the track. Send me the resulting file via text or whatever and I can update the video with a square including you playing along.

There's not much documentation, and fortunately the app is so simple that you don't need much, but here's a page from the manufacturer that I found very useful at the beginning: [Getting the most out of the free Spire app](https://www.izotope.com/en/learn/getting-the-most-out-of-the-free-spire-ios-app.html).
