Dark Star Orchestra announced two shows at the Hawaii Theater, and Matt had a vision: an after party!    

We played from about 11:00pm to 1:30am at Proof Social Club in Chinatown, about one block from the Hawaii Theater. 

While Matt was very confident that we'd have a good turnout, it was still pretty amazing to discover that people lined up around the block:
