Fare you well, my honey,
A        E                 B
fare you well my only true one.

All the birds that were singing
    A                  B
are flown, except you alone

Going to leave this Brokedown Palace,
E               C#m           A            E
On my hands and knees, I will roll, roll, roll
E             G#         A       E
Make myself a bed by the waterside,
E                 F#           A            E
In my time, in my time, I will roll, roll, roll
E         G#               A                E      F#
In a bed, in a bed, by the waterside I will lay my head
E                   F#                  A       E
Listen to the river sing sweet songs to rock my soul

River gonna take me, sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy all the way back home
It's a far-gone lullaby sung many years ago
Mama, Mama, many worlds I've come
since I first left home

Going home, going home
by the waterside I will rest my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
to rock my soul

Going to plant a weeping willow
On the bank's green edge, it will grow, grow, grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go, the river will roll, roll, roll

Fare you well, fare you well
I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs to rock my soul.
