# Resources

Here are some helpful resources for Jerry's music.  

### The Book

The most important and useful resource is the [The Book](deadr5v4.pdf), a free, crowd-sourced, 300 page PDF file containing the words and chords to 250+ songs in the Grateful Dead and Jerry's repertoire. 

For maximum spontaneity, we recommend you bring a copy either in electronic or physical form to the jam.

Here is the easiest way to get The Book onto your iPad or iPhone:

  1. Download The Book from this page, then email it to yourself as an attachment. (If this is difficult, send Philip a text or email and he will email it to you.)
  
  2. On your iPad or iPhone, read this email and then click on the attachment to open The Book within your email app.
  
  3. Once The Book is displaying on your screen, tap it to display a box with an upward pointing arrow icon in the top-right corner. 
  
  4. Tap on that box+arrow icon to display options regarding where you can "send" the attachment. Select "Copy to iBooks".  
  
  5. Now The Book will be available as a PDF document within your iBooks application. Open that app and select the deadr5v4 document to display. Note that you can click on a song in the table of contents to go directly to that page. 
 
### ChordPro files

If you use an app like OnSong that prefers tablature in ChordPro format, then here are some sources of ChordPro files with at least some Jerry-related song content:

  * [Philip's public ChordPro songs directory](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/97m0w1rcov4rmy5/AADw0Mjs4yIEiTI1sFLgI5Jqa?dl=0)

### RU Kind

[rukind.com](http://rukind.com/) is a Grateful Dead site with lots of useful musician-related resources: 

  * [tablature](http://rukind.com/html/music/gdtunes/menus/titlemenu.html)
  * [video instruction](http://rukind.com/bickslicks/)
  * [song forum](http://rukind.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=383)

### JDarks

The [JDarks YouTube Video Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/JDarks/videos) contains over 100 free instructional videos on Grateful Dead songs made over a decade. Very informative and entertaining.  Best to start with the oldest videos and work your way forward, as that way you'll best understand as JDarks incrementally reveals his history with the band and its music.  


### Seth Fleishman (Grateful Guitar Lessons)

[Grateful Guitar Lessons](http://www.gratefulguitarlessons.com/) provides dozens of lessons on Grateful Dead songs by Seth Fleishman. He charges a small amount for each lesson but (speaking as a happy customer) they are totally worth the money.
