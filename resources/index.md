# Resources

Here are some helpful resources for Jerry's music.  

### The Book

The most important and useful resource is the [The Book](deadr4.pdf), a free, crowd-sourced, 300 page PDF file containing the words and chords to 250+ songs in the Grateful Dead and Jerry's repertoire. 

For maximum spontaneity, we recommend you bring a copy either in electronic or physical form to the jam.
 
### ChordPro files

If you use an app like OnSong that prefers tablature in ChordPro format, then here are some sources of ChordPro files with at least some Jerry-related song content:

  * [Philip's public ChordPro songs directory](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/97m0w1rcov4rmy5/AADw0Mjs4yIEiTI1sFLgI5Jqa?dl=0)

### RU Kind

[rukind.com](http://rukind.com/) is a Grateful Dead site with lots of useful musician-related resources: 

  * [tablature](http://rukind.com/html/music/gdtunes/menus/titlemenu.html)
  * [video instruction](http://rukind.com/bickslicks/)
  * [song forum](http://rukind.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=383)

### JDarks

The [JDarks YouTube Video Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/JDarks/videos) contains over 100 free instructional videos on Grateful Dead songs made over a decade. Very informative and entertaining.  Best to start with the oldest videos and work your way forward, as that way you'll best understand as JDarks incrementally reveals his history with the band and its music.  


### Seth Fleishman (Grateful Guitar Lessons)

[Grateful Guitar Lessons](http://www.gratefulguitarlessons.com/) provides dozens of lessons on Grateful Dead songs by Seth Fleishman. He charges a small amount for each lesson but (speaking as a happy customer) they are totally worth the money.
