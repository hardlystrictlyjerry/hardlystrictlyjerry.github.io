Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
            E		         A       D
ancient footprints are everywhere.

You could almost think that your seeing double,

On the cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.

Gotta hurry on back to my hotel room,

Where I got me a date with a pretty little girl from Greece.

She promised she'd be there with me,

When I paint my masterpiece.

Oh, the hours I’ve spent inside the Coliseum
Dodging lions and wastin’ time
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see ’em
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb
Train wheels runnin’ through the back of my memory
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece

Sailin’ round the world in a dirty gondola
Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin’ muscles
Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside
Newspapermen eating candy
Had to be held down by big police
Someday, everything is gonna be diff’rent
When I paint my masterpiece
