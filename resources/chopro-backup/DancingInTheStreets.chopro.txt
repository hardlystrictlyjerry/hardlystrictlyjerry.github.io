{t:Dancing in the streets}
{st:Martha Reeves}

{c: Verse: A D, Bridge: C# F#m B E A }

Calling out around the world,
Are you ready for a brand new beat?
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the street.
They're dancing in Chicago, down in New Orleans,
In New York City.

All we need is music, sweet music.
There'll be music everywhere.
There'll be swinging and swaying and records playing,
Dancing in the street.

Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear,
Just as long as you are there.
So come on, every guy, grab a girl.
Everywhere around the world
They'll be dancing. They're dancing in the street.

It's an invitation across the nation,
A chance for folks to meet.
There'll be laughing, singing, and music swinging,
Dancing in the street.
Philadelphia, P.A. Baltimore and D.C. now.
Can't forget the Motor City.

All we need is music, sweet music.
There'll be music everywhere.
There'll be swinging and swaying and records playing,
Dancing in the street.

Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear,
Just as long as you are there.
So come on, every guy, grab a girl.
Everywhere around the world
They're dancing. They're dancing in the street.

Way down in L.A., every day, they're dancing in the street
Let's get a big strong line, get in time, they're dancing in the street
Across the ocean blue, me and you, we're dancing in the street
