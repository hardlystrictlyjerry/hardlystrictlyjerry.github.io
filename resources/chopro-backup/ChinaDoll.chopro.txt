{C: Dm Fmaj7 Bdim Bb A7 | Dm F C A7}

A pistol shot at five o'clock, the bells of heaven ring
Tell me what you done it for. No I won't tell you a thing

Yesterday I begged you before I hit the ground
All I leave behind me is only what I found

If you can abide it let the hurdy gurdy play
Stranger ones have come by here before they flew away

I will not condemn you nor yet would I deny
I would ask the same of you, but failing, will not die

{C: Ending Dm F C Am A7 D // A // G  // D}

Take up your china doll, it's only fractured
And just a little nervous from the fall
La la la la la la la
