{t: I won't grow up}
{st: Carolyn Leigh, Mark Charlap}

I [F]won't grow up [F#dim] 
I don't [Gm7]wanna go to school[C7] 
Just to [Gm7]learn to be a puppet[C7] 
And re[F]cite a silly rule[F7]

If [Bb]growing up means [Bbm6]it would be 
Be[Dm]neath my [Dm7]dignity to [D7]climb a tree 
I [Bm7b5]won't grow up, won't [Bbm6]grow up, won't [C7]grow up 
Not [F]me

I won't grow up
I don't wanna wear a tie
Or a serious expression
In the middle of July

And if it means that I must prepare 
To shoulder burdens with a worried air 
I'll never grow up, won't grow up, never grow up 
So there

[Bb]Never gonna be a man 
[C7#5]I [F]won't! 
[Bb]Like to see somebody try 
[C7#5]And [F]make me! 
[Bbm6]Anyone who wants to try 
[Dm]And [Dm7]make me [Gm7]turn into a man 
[C7]Catch me if you [C7#5]can

I won't grow up
I don't wanna wear a tie
Or a serious expression
In the middle of July

Growing up's awfuller than 
All the awful things that never been 
I won't grow up, won't grow up, won't grow up 
Again

[C7#5]Not [F]me 
[C7#5]Not [F]I
