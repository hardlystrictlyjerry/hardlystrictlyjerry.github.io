G      B7    C       G            G
Take me to another place she said,
F          C          D11*
take me to another time
G      B7     C       G
Run with me across the oceans,
F            C      D      A  C  C/B  Am
float me on a silver cloud--------------.

G                  C
If i could i would, but i don't know how,
G                 C
if i could i would, but i don't know how
Bm           C                       D  C  C/B  Am   G
If i could i would, and i'd take you now

{c: G9 arpeggio}

Stay with me till time turns over
I wanna feel me feet leave the ground
Take me where the whispering breezes can
lift me up and spin me around...

If i could i would, but i don't know how,
if i could i would, but i don't know how
If i could i would, and i'd take you now

D          A             C         G
Hear you laughing as we go (i'd take you now )
D         A                  C                  G
Flipping backwards through the doors and through the windows (i'd take you now )
D            A                   C  C/B  Am
         I'm melting into nothing

{c: Chorus 2x}
