I drive a mail train, Mama, can't buy a thrill.
I've been up all night, leaning on the windowsill.
Well, if I die on top of the hill,
Well, if I don't make it you know my Baby will.

(Short Lead)

Don't the moon look good, Mama, shining through the tree?
Don't the brakeman look good Mama, flagging down the "Double E"?
Don't the Sun look good goin' down over the sea?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?

(Lead)

Now the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
Well I want to be your lover, Baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
Don't say I never warned you when you train gets lost.
Don't say I never warned you when you train gets lost.
Don't say I never warned you when you trai___n gets lost.
