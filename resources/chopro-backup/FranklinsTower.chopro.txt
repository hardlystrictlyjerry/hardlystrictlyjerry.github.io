In another times forgotten space,
Your eyes looked from your mother's face.
Wildflower seed on the sand and stone,
May the four winds blow you safely home.
Roll away, Roll away the dew. Roll away, Roll away the dew.

I'll tell you where the four winds dwell.
In Franklin's tower there hangs a bell.
It can ring, turn night to day.
It can ring like fire when you loose your way.
Roll away, Roll away the dew. Roll away, Roll away the dew.

God save the child that rings that bell.
It may have one good ring baby, you can't tell.
One watch by night, one watch by day.
If you get confused listen to the music play.

Some come to laugh their past away.
Some come to make it just one more day.
Whichever way your pleasure tends.
If you plant ice you're gonna harvest the wind.
Roll away, Roll away the dew. Roll away, Roll away the dew.
