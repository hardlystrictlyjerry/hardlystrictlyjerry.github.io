{t: Six Days on the Road}
{st: Dave Duddley}

Well I pulled outta Pittsburgh a rollin' down that Eastern Sea board
I got my diesel wound up and she's a runnin' like a never before
There's a speed zone ahead alright, I don't see a cop in sight
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna see my baby tonight

I got me ten forward gears and my George overdrive
Takin' little white pills and my eyes are open wide
I just passed a Jimmy in white, I've been passin' everything in sight
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna see my baby tonight

Well it seems like a month since I kissed my baby goodbye
I could have a lotta women but I'm not like that sort of a guy
I could find one to hold me tight but I could never make believe it's alright
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna see my baby tonight

ICC is a checkin' on down the line
I'm a little overweight and my log book's way behind
But nothin' bothers me tonight, I can dodge all the scales alright
Six days on the Six days on the road and I'm a gonna see my baby tonight

Well my rig's a little old but that don't mean she's slow
There's a flame from my stack and that smoke's blowin' black as coal
My hometown's a comin' in sight, if you think I'm a happy you're right
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna see my baby tonight
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna see my baby tonight
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna see my baby tonight
