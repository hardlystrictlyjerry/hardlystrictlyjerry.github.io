{t:I've been all around this world}
{st:Grateful Dead}

Up on the Blue Ridge Mountain, there I'll take my stand
Up on the Blue Ridge Mountain, there I'll take my stand
Rifle on my shoulder, 6 shooter in my hand
Lord, Lord, I've been all around this world

Lulu, my Lulu, come and open the door
Lulu, my Lulu, come and open the door
Before I have to walk on in with my old 44
Lord, Lord, I've been all around this world

Mama and Papa, little sister makes 3
Mama and Papa, little sister makes 3
They're comin' in the mornin', that's the last you'll see of me
Lord, Lord, I've been all around this world

Hang me, oh, hang me, so I'll be dead and gone
Hang me, oh, hang me, so I'll be dead and gone
I wouldn't mind you hangin', boys, but you wait in jail so long
Lord, I've been all around this world

Up on the Blue Ridge Mountain, there I'll take my stand
Up on the Blue Ridge Mountain, there I'll take my stand
A rifle on my shoulder, 6 shooter in my hand
Lord, Lord, I've been all around this world
