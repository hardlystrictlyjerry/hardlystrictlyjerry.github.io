I've been warped by the rain, driven by the snow
I'm drunk and dirty, don't you know
And I'm still, willin'
And I was out on the road late at night
I seen my pretty Alice in every headlight
Alice, Dallas Alice

And I've been from Tucson to Tucumcari, Tehachapi to Tonopah
Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
Driven the back roads so I wouldn't get weighed
And if you give me; weed, whites, and wine
And you show me a sign
I'll be willin', to be movin'

Well I've been kicked by the wind, robbed by the sleet
Had my head stoved in, but I'm still on my feet
And I'm still, willin'
I smuggled some smokes and folks from Mexico
Baked by the sun every time I go to Mexico
And I'm still....
