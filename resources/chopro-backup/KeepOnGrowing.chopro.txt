I was laughing, Playing in the streets, I was unknowing; 
I didn't know my fate. 
Playing the game of love, but never really showing; 
I thought that love could wait. 

I was a young man and sure to go astray. 
You walked right into my life and told me love would find a way 
To keep on growing, keep on growing, keep on growing. 

I was standing, Looking in the face of one who loved me, 
Feeling so ashamed. 
Hoping and praying, Lord, that she could understand me, 
But I didn't know her name. 

She took my hand in hers and told me I was wrong. 
She said, you're gonna be all right boy, oh just as long 
As you keep on growing, keep on growing, keep on growing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Maybe, someday baby, who knows where or when, Lord, 
Just you wait and see. 
We'll be walking, together hand in hand, alone forever; 
Woman just you and me. 

'Cause time is gonna change us, Lord, and I know it's true; 
Our love is gonna keep on glowing and growing and it's all we gotta do.

Keep on growing, keep on growing, keep on growing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Keep on growing, keep on growing, keep on growing.
