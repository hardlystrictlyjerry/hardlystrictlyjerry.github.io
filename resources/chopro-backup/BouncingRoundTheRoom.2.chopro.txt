    G           D                    A              D
The Woman was a dream I had though rather hard to keep
    G                 D                    A
for when my eyes were watching hers they closed, and I was still asleep.
D                    A                             G             (D)
For when my hand was holding hers she whispered words and I awoke
D           A                            C                G                 (D)
And faintly bouncing around the room, the echo of whomever spoke and I awoke
D            A                           C                G        > A
and faintly bouncing around the room, the echo of whomever spoke.

    G               D                  A              D
The place I saw was far beneath the surface of the sea
   G                  D              A
My sight was poor But I was sure The sirens sang their songs for me
D                   A                    G                  D
They dance above me as I sink I see them through, a crystal haze

D           A                           C            G                      (D)
And hear em bouncing round the room the never ending coral maze. a crystal
D                A                          C                   G
haze & hear them bouncing round the room the never ending coral maze
C                  G              A
That time then and once again I'm bouncing around the room.
