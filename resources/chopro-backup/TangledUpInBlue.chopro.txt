{t: Tangled up in blue}
{st: Bob Dylan}

Early one mornin' the sun was shinin', I was layin' in bed,
Wond'rin if she'd changed at all if her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Never did like Mama's homemade dress Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
I was standin' on the side of the road rain fallin' on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through.

She was married when we first met soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could abandoned it out West
Split up on docks that night night both agreeing it was best,
She turned around to look at me as I was walkin' away
I heard her say over my shoulder, We'll meet again someday on the avenue,

I had a job in the great north woods working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much and one day the axe just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans where I was lucky to be employed,
Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat right outside of Del-a-Croix,
But all the while I was alone the past was close behind
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind, and I just grew,

She was workin' in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear
And later on as the crowd thinned out I's just about to do the same
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't you know my name?"
I muttered somethin' under my breath She studied the lines on my face,
Must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe,
"I thought you'd never say hello", she said "You look like the silent type."
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burnin' coal
Pourin' off of every page like it was written in my soul From me to you,

I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air
He started into dealing with slaves and something inside him died
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside.
And when finally the bottom fell out I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keepin' on Like a bird that flew,

Now I'm goin' back again I got to get her to somehow,
All the people we used to know they're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians some are carpenter's wives
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doin' with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same we just saw it from another point of view.
