{t:After Midnight}
{st: JJ Cale}

{c: |:  E / G / A :| E / G / A / B}

After midnight we gonna let it all hang down
After midnight we gonna chugalug and shout

Gonna stimulate some action:
We gonna get some satisfaction
We gonna find out what it is all about
After midnight we gonna let it all hang down

{c: Lead}

After midnight we gonna shake your tambourine
After midnight all gonna be peaches and cream

Gonna cause talk and suspicion:
We gonna give an exhibition
We gonna find out what it is all about
After midnight we gonna let it all hang down

{c: Jam in E -> Verse 1 repeat -> Instrumental tag to end }
