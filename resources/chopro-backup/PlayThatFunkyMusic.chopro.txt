{t:Play that funky music}

[Em]Once I was a boogie singer playin' in a rock and roll band.
I never had no problems burning down the one night stands.
But everything around me got to start to feelin' so low.
And I decided quickly to disco down and check out the show.

Chorus
Yeah they was dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin',
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted:
[Gm7]Play that funky music white boy, play that funky music right
Play that funky music [Bbm]white boy
[Em]Lay down the [Bm]boogie and [A7]play that funky [B7]music till you die


[Em7]I tried to understand it, I thought that they were out of their minds.
How could I be so foolish to not see I was the one behind?
But still I kept on fighting losing every step of the way.
I said I must go back there and check to see if things still the same.

(Chorus)

Now first it wasn't easy changin' rock and rollin' minds 
Things were getting shaky I thought I'd have to leave it behind
But now it's so much better I'm funking out in every way
But I'll never lose that feelin' of how I learned my lesson that day

(Chorus)

Play that funky music, play that funky music,
Play that funky music, play that funky music,
Play that funky music, play that funky music,
