{t:Playing in the Band}
{st: Grateful Dead}

D                                                   D  A  D
Some folks trust to reason others trust to might,

D                                                      D A D
I don't trust to nothin', but I know it comes out right.
D                                                     D A D
Say it once again now, Whoa, I hope you'll understand
D                                                  D  A  D
When it's done and over, look, a man is just a man.
D                              D  A  D
Playin', playin' in the band.   Daybreak, daybreak on the land.

(D riff)

Some folks look for answers others look for fights,
Some folks up in treetops just a looking for their kites.
Whoa, I can tell your future just look what's in your hand,
But I can't stop for nothin' I'm just playing in the band.
Playin', playin' in the band. Daybreak, daybreak on the land.

A            E  A
E   A
A            E  A
G  D  A
(repeat)

(10 beats on A, then)
Bm    G
D     Gm

Standin' on a tower world at my command
You just keep a turnin' while I'm playing in the band.
And if a man among you got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me for playing in the band.

Playin', playin' in the band.
Daybreak, daybreak on the land.
Playin', like a wave upon the sand
Daybreak, while I'm playin' in the band

(Jam into Space into Throwing Stones riff)
