{st: Stevie Wonder}

Intro
|: C Gm A7/Bb Dm Fm :|


Good morn or evening friends
Here's your friendly announcer
I have serious news to pass on to everybody

What I'm about to say
Could mean the world's disaster
Could change your joy and laughter to tears and pain

It's that love's in need of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
Hate's goin' round breaking many hearts
Stop it please before it's gone too far

The force of evil plans
To make you its possession
And it will if we let it
Destroy ev-er-y-body

We all must take precautionary measures
If love and please you treasure
Then you'll hear me when I say that

(Chorus)
