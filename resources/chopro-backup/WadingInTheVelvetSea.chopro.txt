Chorus:
I've been wading in the velvet sea (3x)
I've been wading in the.. (2x)

I took a moment from my day
Wrapped it up in things you say
Mailed it off to your address
You'll get it pretty soon unless

The packaging begins to break
And all the points I tried to make
Are tossed with thoughts into a bin
Time leaks out my life leaks in

(Duet begins)

You won't find moments in a box
And someone else will set your clocks
I took a moment from my day
Wrapped it up in things you say
And mailed it off to you

You won't find moments in a box
And someone else will set your clocks
I took a moment from my day

Chorus
