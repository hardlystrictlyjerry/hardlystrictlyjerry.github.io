{c: Better in D or in E?}

[D]In the attics of my life, [G]full of [D]clou[A]dy [G]dreams [D]unreal. 
[D]Full of tastes no tongue can know, [G]and [D]lights no [A]eye can [D]see.   
[D]When [F#]there [G]was no [D]ear to [G]hea[E]r, you sang to [D]me.   

[D]I have spent my life seeking all that's still unsung.   
[E]Bent my ear [B]to [E]hear [B]the [E]tune, [A]and [E]closed [B]my [A]eyes to [E]see.   
[E]When [Ab]there [A]were no [E]strings [F#m]to [E]play[A], you played to [F#m]me. [F#] [B]  

[B]In the book [A]of love's own [D]dream[A] [E]where all the print is [A]blood.        
[A]Where all the pages are my [D]days, [B]and all my lights grow [E]old.   
[A]When I had no wings to [D]fly, [E]you flew to [D]me, [B]you flew to [A]me. [E]   

In the secret space of dreams, where I dreaming lay amazed.   
When the secrets all are told, and the petals all unfold.   
When there was no dream of mine, you dreamed of me.
