Ocelot Ocelot where have you gone
A                                  B
Morning is over and noon slouches on

B                                            E
your stripes would all fade in the poisonous day
     A                    E               B
when you see the sunlight move out of the way

F#                                         B
you prance with the beast who parade every night
F#                                         B
and silently slouch through the forest by light

B                                 E
Don't be the only one left on the block
     A                E                  B
come hide in the herd and float with the flock

Ocelot Ocelot where are you now?
you never listened to me anyhow
you wandered and ambled you walked now you run
knowing you'll bake like a snake in the sun
you prance with the beast who parade every night
and silently slouch through the forrest by light

Don't be the only one left on the block
come hide in the herd and float with the flock
