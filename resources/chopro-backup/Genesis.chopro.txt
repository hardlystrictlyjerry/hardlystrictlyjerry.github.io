{t:Genesis}
{st: Jorma Kaukonen}

The time has come for us to pause 
And think of living as it was 
Into the future we must cross (must cross) 
And I'd like to go with you 
And I'd like to go with you

You say I'm harder than a wall 
A marble shaft about to fall 
I love you dearer than them all (them all) 
So let me stay with you 
So let me stay with you

And as we walked into the day 
Skies of blue had turned to grey 
I might have not been clear to say (to say) 
I never looked away 
I never looked away

And though I'm feeling you inside 
My life is rolling with the tide 
I'd like to see it be an open ride 
Along with you 
Going along with you

The time we borrowed from ourselves 
Can't stay within a vaulted well 
And living turns into a lender's well 
So let me come with you 
And let me come with you

And when we came out into view 
And there I found myself with you 
And breathing felt like something new
Along with you 
Going along with you
