I`m begging of you please dont`t take my man
Cm D# A# Cm
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
A# Gm Cm
Please don`t take him just because you can

Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And i cannot compete with you, Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing i can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
And i can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don`t know what he means to me, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I`m begging of you please don`t take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don`t take him just because you can

you could have your choice of men
But i could never love again
He`s the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happines depends on you
Whatever you decide to do, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I`m begging of you please don`t take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don`t take him even though you can
