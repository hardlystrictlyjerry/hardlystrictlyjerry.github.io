{c: |: B7 / AE B :| }

Baby here I am
I'm the man on the scene
I can give you what you want
But you gotta' come home with me
I have got some good old lovin'
And I got more in store
When I get through throwin' it on to you
You gotta' come back for more

{c: | F# /// | % | B --- | ---- ||: A E B / :||}

Boys and things will come by the dozen
That ain't nothing but drug store lovin'
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle, now yes I am

Action speaks louder than words
And I'm a man of great experience
I know you've got another man
But I can love you better than him
Take my hand don't be afraid
I'm gonna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free
So you can place your ad with me

Boys will come along a dime by the dozen
That ain't nothing but ten cent lovin'
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yessir'am

{c: Jam: B7 /// |: B / A / D / F# :| F# / / / }

Vocal jam:
Give it to me baby, I got to have it, some of your love
It's all I need, Early in the morning, late in the evening (continue with adlib).
