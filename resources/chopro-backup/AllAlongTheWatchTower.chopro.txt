"There must be someway out of here!"
Cried the Joker to the Thief.
"There's too much confusion,
I can't get no relief.
Businessmen they drink their wine.
Plowmen dig my earth.
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth."

"No reason to get excited,"
The Thief he kindly spoke.
"There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke.
But you and I, we've been through that.
And this is not our fate.
So let us not talk falsely now,
The hour is getting late."

All along the watchtower,
Princess kept the view.
While all the women came and went,
Barefoot servants too.
Outside in the distance,
A wild rat did growl.
Two riders were approaching,
The wind began to howl.
