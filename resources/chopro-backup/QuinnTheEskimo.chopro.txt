{t:Quinn the Eskimo}
{st:Bob Dylan}
{key: C}

{c: All three verses before a solo, then acapella, then final chorus}

Well, everybody's building the big ships and the boats
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
Everybody's gonna jump for joy

Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

I like to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet
But jumping queues and making haste just ain't my cup of meat.
Everybody's out there feeding pigeons on a limb
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
The pigeons gonna run to him

(Chorus)

A cat's meow and a cow's moo, you know, I can recite them all,
Tell me where it hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes
When Quinn the Eskimo gets here
Everybody's gonna wanna doze

(Chorus)
