{t:Ain't no bread in the breadbox}
{st: Norton Buffalo}

There ain't no bread in the breadbox
'Cause we ain't got no dough
And it's seems like we ain't got enough time
To go foolin' around no more
I've been working so hard for oh so long
What've you got to show?

Open up your eyes little darling
[E]Let's pack up your things and [A]go
[E]Open up your eyes little darling

[E]Don't want to live here no [A]more
[E]Open up your eyes little darling
[E]Been here for far too [A]long
[E]Open up your eyes little darling
[A]It's time to [B]move [E]along

[Instrumental]

[E]Late into December on a cold winter day
[E]I'd just finished bringing wood into the kitchen when I [A]heard my Amanda [B]say
She said [F#m]Elijah, [G#m]you better look around
[F#m]Things ain't like [G#m]they used to be
[A]Times getting [G#m]hard for you and me
[F#m]Come on daddy, it's time to shake things [B]down
