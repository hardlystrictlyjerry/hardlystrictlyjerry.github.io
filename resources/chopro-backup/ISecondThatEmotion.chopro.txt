Maybe you'll wanna give me kisses sweet
But only for one night with no repeat
And maybe you'll go away and never call
And a taste of honey is worse than none at all

In that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart
Oh, if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion,
I second that emotion
If you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

Maybe you'll think that love would tie you down
You don't have the time to hang around
Maybe you'll think that love was made for fools
And so you think it's wise to break the rules
