[Em11]What are you [A11]waiting for, be[G]lieve[Bm] in [A]me
[Em11]Isn't it [A11]love in this life [G]that[Bm] you [A]need
[F]You can offer your [Am]soul to an altar of [Bm]sacri[Em7]fice
But [D/F#]give [G]your [A7]heart to [D]me

{soc:}
[D]Let's [Em]bring [G]Heaven [A]down [D]here
Let's [Em]bring [G]Heaven [A]on [Bm]down
I [A]don't want to [G]wait for the [D/F#]angels
[Em]Let's bring [A11]Heaven down [D]here
{eoc:}

What's in the sky that you and I can't find
Simply in love what could be more divine
How can I make you believe forever and ever more
I'll give my heart to you

[Gm7]Can I lay you [Bb]down
Don't you know sal[F]vation is the [Am]warmth [G/B]of [C]my em[Dm7]brace
[Gm7]Let me touch your [Bb]lips
Kiss the moonlight [F]on your face
I [G]need [A]you [Em]now
I need you now
