Everything I do gohn be funky!
Everything I do gohn be funky from now on, yeah
Everything I do gohn be funky from now on
I have to be myself & do my thing
A little soul can't do no harm, yeah

Everything I do gohn be funky from now on, yeah
Everything I do gohn be funky from now on, yeah
Everything I do gohn be funky from now on, yeah

Some may say I've got no class, but I'm doin' what I wanna do
So go with me if you can, or just do what you can do
Oh shucks! Why you whinin'? I'm on fire
Everything I do gohn be funky from now on, yeah
Everything I do gohn be funky from now on
Never before have I felt so good just bein' natural me
My little hang up & my little times, but deep inside I'm free
Let your hair down, get down wings
Who's to say what's right or wrong?

Everything I do gohn be funky from now on
Everything I do gohn be funky from now on
Everything I do gohn be funky from now on
Everything I do gohn be funky from now on
Everything I do gohn be funky from now on
Oh shucks! Do your thing!
