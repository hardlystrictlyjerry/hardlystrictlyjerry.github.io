              A   G  A                A   G  A
Inside you’re burnin’ I can see clear through
A  G A                                 A  G A
Your eyes tell more then you mean them to
           A  G A                     A   G  A
Lit up and flashin’ like the reds and blues
A  G A                    A  G A
Out there on the neon avenues

       C#m B C#m               C#m B C#m
But I           (feel like a stranger)
C#m  B  C#m            C#m  B  D
feel like a stranger

Well, the music’s thunderin’, restless and hot,
You keep firin’ glances across the room
And I can’t stop wonderin’ just what you got
Get the feelin’ I’m gonna find out real soon

Still I (feel like a stranger) feel like a stranger

E
You know it’s gonna get stranger
                          D
So let’s get on with this show


Yes, and the wheels get smokin’ ‘round midnight
You shoot me a look that says let’s go
Yes, and it feels about like runnin’ a red light
Well, there ain’t no point in lookin’ behind us, no

But I (feel like stranger) feel like a stranger

Keeps gettin’ stranger and stranger
If it’s love now, how would I know?

Jam on C#m B C#m
