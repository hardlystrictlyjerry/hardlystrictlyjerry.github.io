Wake up little Susie, wake up. Wake up little Susie, wake up.
The movie wasn't so hot, it didn't have much of a plot
We fell asleep, our goose is cooked, our reputation is shot
Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie

What are you gonna tell your mama, what you gonna tell your pa
What are you gonna tell your friend when they say ooo la la
Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie

Well I told your mama that you'd be back by ten
Now Susie, baby looks like we goofed again
Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie, we gotta go home

Wake up little Susie, wake up. Wake up little Susie, wake up.
We both fell sound asleep, wake up little Susie and weep
The movie's over it's four o'clock and we're in trouble deep
Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie
