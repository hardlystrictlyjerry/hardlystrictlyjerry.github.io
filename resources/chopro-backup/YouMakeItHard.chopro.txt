[A]You make it hard, [D]you make it hard on [A]me. [D]
[A]You make it hard, [D]you make it hard on [A]me. [D]
[A]Well I told myself I didn’t [C#]need the complications
Then I [D]kissed your lips and what a [F]sweet sensation
[A]You make it hard, [E7]you make it hard on [A]me. [E7]

You make it hard, you make it hard on me.
You make it hard, you make it hard on me.
Well I tried to live my life footloose and free
Then I touched your lips and honey ooh wee
You make it hard, you make it hard on me.

{soc:}
[B]I was the king of hugging and kissing [B][C][C#][D]
[D]Till you showed me what [E]I’d been missing [A] [D]
{eoc:}

You make it hard, you make it hard on me.
You make it hard, you making it hard on me.
Well I told myself I didn’t need the complications
Then I kissed your lips and what a sweet sensation
You make it hard, you make it hard on me.
