{t:Think of what you've done}
{st:Stanley Brothers}
 
Is it true that I've lost you?
Am I not the only one?
After all this pain and sorrow
Darlin', think of what you've done 

Heart to heart, dear, how I need you
Like the flowers need the dew
Lovin' you has been my life blood
I can't believe we're really through 

Is it true that I've lost you?
Am I not the only one?
After all this pain and sorrow
Darlin', think of what you've done 

I look back to old Virginia
Where the mountains meet the skies
In those hills I learned to love you
Let me stay there till I die 

Is it true that I've lost you?
Am I not the only one?
After all this pain and sorrow
Darlin', think of what you've done 

Is it true that I've lost you?
Am I not the only one?
After all this pain and sorrow
Darlin', think of what you've done
