{t:Sweet and Dandy}
{st: Toots and the Maytals}

Etty in the room a cry
Mama say she must wipe her eye
Papa say she no fi foolish
Like she never been to school at all
It is no wonder, It's a perfect ponder
While they were dancing in that ball room last night

Johnson in the room afret
Uncle say he must hold up him head
Aunty say him no fi foolish
Like a not time fi him wedding day
It is no wonder, It's a perfect ponder
While they were dancing in that ball room last night

One pound ten for the wedding cake
Twenty bottle of cola wine
All the people them dress up in a white
Fi go eat out Johnson wedding cake
It is no wonder, It's a perfect ponder
While they were dancing in that ball room last night, yeah, yeah

(Repeat all verses above... then)

But it was sweet and dandy 
sweet and dandy (x7)

It was sweet and dandy! (x4)
