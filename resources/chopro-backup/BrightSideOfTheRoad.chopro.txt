{t: Bright Side of the Road}
{st: Van Morrison}

From the dark end of the street (from the dark end of the street)
To the bright side of the road (to the bright side of the road)
We'll be lovers once again on the bright side of the road.

Little Darling come with me (Little Darling come with me)
To help me share my load (to help me share my load)
From the dark end of the street, to the bright side of the road.

As this life it went on, sometimes we don't even know why.
And time seems to go by so fast, in the twinkling of your eye.

So let's enjoy it while we can (let's enjoy it while we can)
You can help me share my load (help me share my load)
From the dark end of the street, to the bright side of the road.

[Lead (multi-round) that eventually ends with the C7 to go into the chorus.]

And we'll be lovers once again on the bright side of the road.
And we'll be lovers once again on the bright side of the road.
And we'll be lovers once again on the bright side of the road.
