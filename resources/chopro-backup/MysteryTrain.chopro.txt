Train I ride, 15 coaches long
Train I ride, 15 coaches long
Well, the woman I love, she's on that train and gone

Train, train, comin' round the track
Train, train, comin' round the track
Well, it took my baby, but she's never coming back

(Solo)

(Break)
Well I went down to the station, to meet my baby at the gate,
Asked the station master is that train a running late?
He said if you're a waiting on the 444,
I hate to tell you son that train don't stop here anymore

Mystery train smoking down the track
Mystery train smoking down the track
Well I don't want no ride
Just bring my baby back


Train, train, comin' down, down the line
Train, train, comin' down the line
Well, it's bringin' my baby, 'cause she's mine all, all mine
She's mine, all, all mine

Train, train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend (around and around the bend)
Train, train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend ('round the bend)
Well, it took my baby, but it never will again, it never will again
Woo-woo
