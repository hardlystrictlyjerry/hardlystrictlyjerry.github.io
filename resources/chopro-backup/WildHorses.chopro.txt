[Bm]Childhood [G]living [Bm]It's easy to [G]do
[Am]The things you [C]wanted [D] [G]I bought them for [D]you
[Bm]Graceless [G]lady [Bm]you know who I [G]am
[Am]You know I [C]can't let [D]you [G]slide through my [D]hands
      
[Am]Wild [C]horses [D] [G]couldn't [F]drag me [C]away
[Am]Wild wild [C]horses [G]we'll [F]ride them [C]some day.
  
I watched you suffer a dull aching pain
Now you've decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter  or  treat you unkind  
      
I know I've dreamed you, a sin and a lie.
I have my freedom but I don't have much time  
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried
Let's do some living, after we die...
