{t:Baby I Love You}
{st:Aretha Franklin}

[C]If you want my loving, [F]if you really do
[C]Don't be afraid baby, just ask me,
[G]You know I'm gonna give it to [C]you.

[C]Oh and I do declare (I do), I want to see you with it
[F]Stretch out your arms little girl, you're gonna get it
Cause [C]I love you (baby, baby, baby I love you)

[C]Ain't no doubt about it, Baby I [F]love you,
[C]I love you, I love you, I love you, baby I love you

If you feel you want to kiss me, go right ahead I don't mind
All you got to do is, snap your fingers and I'll come running
I ain't lying (I ain't lying)
Oh! What you want? Little girl, you know you got it.
I'd deny my own self before I see you without it
Cause I love you (Baby, baby, baby I love you)
Ain't no doubt about it, baby I love you, 
I love you, I love you, I love you, baby I love you

[F]Someday you might want to run away 
[C]and leave me sittin' here to cry
[F]But if it's all the same to you baby 
I'm gonna [G]stop you from saying goodbye

Baby I love you, Baby I need ya, Said I want ya
Got to have you baby, 
Don't let your neighbors tell you I don't want you
