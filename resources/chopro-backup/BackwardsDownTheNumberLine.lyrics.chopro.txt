{t:Backwards down the numberline (lyrics}
{st:Phish}

Happy happy oh my friend,
Blow out candles once again
Leave the presents all inside
Take  my  hand and let's take a ride    
Backwards down the number line

You were eight and I was nine
Do you know what happened then?
Do you know why we're still friends?
Laughing all these many years

We pushed through hardships tasted tears
Made a promise one to keep    
I can still recite it in my sleep
Every time a birthday comes
Call your friend and sing a song               
Or whisper it into his ear
Or write it down, just don't miss a year

Chorus:
You decide what it contains
How long it goes but this remains
The only rule is it begins
"Happy happy oh my friend"

Bridge:
And when I see you coming
down the line with eyes wide open
Somewhere in between the past and future,
where you drift in time,
You can see a different point of view

Repeat Chorus
