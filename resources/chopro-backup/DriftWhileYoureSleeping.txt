{t:Drift While You're Sleeping (excerpt)}
{st:Trey Anastasio}

We are wind, we are wind and you can't hold on
Hold on to anything you see and it's gone
Gone in a heartbeat, fleeting it's gone
We are wind, we are wind,
We crumble into nothing, we are wind

Two hearts beat folded together
For one brief moment everything fits
The sun feels warm and that heat there is truth
But this life is a stage set
The same sun rose on everyone
Whoever lived or died in that same sunset

So I guess that the good times turned out to be
Just a temporary reprieve from gravity
A nice trip over the falls in a barrel with me
We'll do it again when we meet on the other side

And Charon in your filthy cloak
I'll take my friend on this ferry ride
You can still have your obol
But we don't need a guide so step aside

And that thin thin bubble I know what it is
I see it, I see it, It's always been there
It's stronger than words, It's stronger than time
It's the line drawn between us
It's love, it's love, It always was
And it is and it always will be love
And it is and it was and it will be love
It is and it always will be love
It's love, it's love It always was
And it is and it always will be love

We move through stormy weather
We know that our days are few
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And we dream and we struggle together
But love will carry us through
But love will carry us through
