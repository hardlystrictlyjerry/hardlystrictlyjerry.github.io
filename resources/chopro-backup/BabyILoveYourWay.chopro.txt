{c: Chorus: |: G#m | B | F#m | B :|}
 
Shadows grow so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly the day turns into night
Far away from the city

Well, don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait,
Ooh, baby, I love your way, 
I wanna tell you I love your way, 
I wanna be with you night and day

The moon appears to shine and light the skies
With the help of some fireflies
I wonder how they have the power to shine
I can see them under the pine

(Chorus)

I can see the sunset in your eyes
Brown and grey, and blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
I wish I could buy one out of season
