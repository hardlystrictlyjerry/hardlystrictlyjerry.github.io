Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming,
Head's all empty and I don't care,
Saw my baby down by the river,
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air.

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow,
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature,
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

She's got everything delightful, she's got everything I need,
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double, pays my ticket when I speed

(Lead=Verse)

She comes skimmin' through rays of violet,
She can wade in a drop of dew,
She don't come and I don't follow,
Waits backstage while I sing to you.

Well, she can dance a Cajun rhythm,
Jump like a willys in four wheel drive
She's a summer love for spring, fall and winter.
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell, Caught up in sunlight,
Come on out singing I'll walk you in the sunshine,
Come on honey, come along with me.

She's got everything delightful, she's got everything I need,
Breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight,
Lazing in the sunshine yes indeed.


[A]Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying, when the moon is half way down,
[B]Sometimes when the [E]night is [B]dying, I take me out and
I [A]wander [EDAB]around, I wander [BAEB]round

[B]Sunshine [E]day[B]dream, [F#]walking in the [E]tall [B]trees
Going where the wind blows, blooming like a red rose
Breathing more freely, ride out singing I'll walking you in the morning sunshine
