{t:Stella Blue}
{st:Grateful Dead}

All the years combine, they melt into a dream
A broken angel sings from a guitar

In the end there's just a song comes crying like the wind
Through all the broken dreams and vanished years
Stella Blue, Stella Blue

When all the cards are down, there's nothing left to see
There's just the pavement left and broken dreams

In the end there's still that song comes crying like the wind
Down every lonely street that's ever been
Stella Blue 

I've stayed in every blue-light cheap hotel can't win for trying
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time
Gonna make em shine

It all rolls into one and nothing comes for free
There's nothing you can hold for very long

And when you hear that song come crying like the wind
It seems like all this life was just a dream
Stella Blue
