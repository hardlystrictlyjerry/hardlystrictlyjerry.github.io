{t:Alabama Getaway}
{st: Grateful Dead}

{c: Intro: | E / D / | D / A C | }

Thirty-two teeth in a jawbone, Alabama's trying for none
Before I have to hit him, I hope he's got the sense to run.
Reason the poor girls love him, he promises them everything.
Why they all believe him, he wears a big diamond ring.

Alabama Getaway, Getaway. Alabama Getaway, Getaway.
Only way to please me, just turn round and leave and walk away.

{c: Lead}

Major Domo Billy Bojangals, sat down and had a drink with me.
Said what about Alabama, which keeps coming back to me.
I Heard your plea in the courthouse, jury box began to rock and rise
Forty-nine sister states had Alabama in their eye.
{c: Chorus}

{c: Lead }

Major said why don't we give him,  rope enough to hang himself?
No need to worry the jury, they probably take care of themselves.
Twenty-third Psalm Majordomo, reserve me a table for three.
Down in the valley of the shadow it's just you Alabama and me.

{c: Lead -> Chorus X 2 -> | A C | four times}
