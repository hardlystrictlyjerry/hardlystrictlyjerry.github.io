Well, me and my uncle went ridin' down
          G                Em
South Colorado, west Texas bound
           G             Em
We stopped over in Sante Fe
               G                G#   A
That bein' the point just about half-way
    G                   B                   Em
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

I took the horses up to the stall 
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, You know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

West Texas cowboys, they's all around,
With liquor and money, they loaded down,
So soon after payday, it seemed a shame,
You know my uncle, he starts playin' the game,
It's high-low Jack and the winner take the hand.

{c: solo}

My uncle starts winning, the cowboys got sore,
One of them called him, and then two more,
Accused him of cheatin', oh no it couldn't be,
I know my uncle he's as honest as me,
And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be.

One of them cowboys he starts to draw,
I shot him down Lord, He never saw,
Shot me another, oh no, he won't grow old,
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold,
And we hightailed it down to Mexico.

Now I love those cowboys, I love their gold,
I love my uncle, God rest his soul,
Taught me good Lord, Taught me all I know,
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold, and
I left his dead ass there by the side of the road
