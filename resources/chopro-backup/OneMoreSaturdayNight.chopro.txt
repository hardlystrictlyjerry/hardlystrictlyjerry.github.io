{t:One More Saturday Night}
{st:Grateful Dead}

I went down to the mountain, I was drinkin’ some wine
Looked up into heaven Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ’ in fire cross the heavens, just as plain as black and white
Get prepared, there’s gonna be a party tonight!

Uh-huh, it’s Saturday night
Well, uh-huh, One more Saturday night
Saturday night

Well, everybody’s dancin’ down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
Tempur’ture keeps risin’ everybody gettin’ high
Come the rockin’ stroke of midnight whole place is gonna fly

{c: Chorus}
{c: Lead }

I turn on channel six the President comes on the news
Says, "I get no satisfaction that’s why I sing the blues"
His wife says, "Don’t get crazy, Lord, you know just what to do.
Crank up that ol’ victrola, break out your rockin’ shoes"

Then God, way up in heaven for whatever it was worth
Thought he’d have a big ol’ party thought he’d call it planet Earth
Don’t worry ‘bout tomorrow, Lord, you’ll know it when it comes
When the rockin’, rollin’ music meets the risin’, shinin’ sun

Playin’ on a Saturday Night,, Playin’ on a Saturday Night
Everybody gettin’ high, playin on a saturday night,
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night
