{c: Intro: |: D / C / G :| }
{c: Bridge:  Bm / G / D }

Little bitty boy, with a heart of steel
You know you can't boogie now, but your sister sure will
Feel good music, I've been told
Good for your body, good for your soul

(Let me hear you say)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Hey Pocky Way
Hey, hey, hey, Hey Pocky Way

(Uptown Ruler, Keep on groovin, Bayou on the bayou, everybody sing)

Lie back grooving in your car
Makes no difference who or where you are
Feel good music in your soul
Makes your body wanna rock 'n' roll

{c: Lead}
{c: Repeat second verse}
{c: 4x Intro to end on D}
