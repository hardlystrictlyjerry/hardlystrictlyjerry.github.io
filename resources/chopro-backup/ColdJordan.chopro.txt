{t:Cold Jordan}
{st:Grateful Dead}

{c: D / G / D / A  etc. }

Oh stranger as you're treading life's journey
Take Jesus as your daily guide
Though you may feel pure and safe here,
Without Him walking by your side
But when you come to make the crossing
At the end of life's pilgrim way
If you're ever gonna need our Savior,
You'll surely need Him on that day.

{c: Chorus }

(Now look at that) cold Jordan
(Look at its) deep water
(Look at that) wide river
Oh, hear the mighty billows roll
(You better take) Jesus with you
(He's a) true companion
(And I'm) sure without Him
That you never will make it o'er

That awful day of judgement,
Is coming in the by and by
We'll see our Lord descending
In glory from on high
So let's keep in touch with Jesus
And in His precious love abide
That we ever may be so ready
When we cross over Jordan's tide

(Chorus)

(Oh what) what you gonna do?
(Oh what) what you gonna say?
How you gonna feel?
When you've come to the end of the way?
