{t:Miss Molly}
{st:Bob Wills}

Oh have you seen Miss Molly, her cheeks are rosy red
Her lips are soft as satin and they taste like gingerbread
Oh oh oh me oh my Miss Molly, I'm in love with you
Oh me oh my Miss Molly, won't you say you love me too

Now when Miss Molly's smiling, the sun is dim a spell
And when she laughs her voice is like a little silver bell
Oh oh oh me oh my Miss Molly, I'm in love with you
Oh me oh my Miss Molly, won't you say you love me too

I'll trade my horse and saddle, cow driving I'll resign
If  only Miss Molly will say that she'll be mine 
Oh oh oh me oh my Miss Moll,y I'm in love with you
Oh me oh my Miss Molly, won't you say you love me too

Now listen dear Miss Molly, I've told you this before
And even though I told you so I'll tell you just once more
Oh oh oh me oh my Miss Molly I'm in love with you
Oh me oh my Miss Molly won't you say you love me too
