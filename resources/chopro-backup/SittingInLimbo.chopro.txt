{t:Sitting in Limbo}
{st:Jimmy Cliff}
 
{c: C | F | G, chorus: Em, Am, D, G }

Sitting here in limbo, but I know it won't be long
Sitting here in limbo, like a bird without a song
Well, they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on.

Sitting here in limbo, waiting for the dice to roll
Sitting here in limbo, got some time to search my soul
Well, they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on

I don't know where life will lead me, but I know where I've been
I can't say what life will show me, but I know what I've seen
Tried my hand at love and friendship, but all that is passed and gone
This little boy is moving on

Sitting here in limbo, waiting for the tide to flow
Sitting here in limbo, knowing that I have to go
Well, they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on

{c: chorus }

Sitting here in limbo waiting for the tide to flow
Sitting here in limbo knowing that I have to go
Well, they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on
