See that girl barefootin' along
Whistling and singing she's a carrying on.
Got laughin' in her eyes, dancing in her feet.
She's a neon light diamond she can live on the street.

Hey, hey (hey) come right away. (Join the party)
Come and join the party every day
Hey, hey, (hey) come right away (Join the party)
Come and join the party every day

Well, everybody’s dancing in a ring around the sun
Nobody's finished, we ain’t even begun
So take off your shoes, child, take off your hat
Try on your wings and find out where it's at.

{c: Chorus -> Lead}

Take a vacation, fall out for a while
Summers comin' in and it's goin' out in style.
Well, lie down smoking, honey, have yourself a ball,
Cause your mother's down in Memphis,
Won't be back till the fall.
