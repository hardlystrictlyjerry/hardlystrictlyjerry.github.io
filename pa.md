<h1><img class="ui avatar image" src="/images/jerryavatar.jpg">HSJ: The Next Generation</h1>

Hi everyone, I am writing this post to initiate a discussion regarding the future of HSJ.

When we began playing together over two years ago, my hope was a semi-regular, semi-quiet, and semi-acoustic gathering of friends to jam.  Two years later, HSJ has totally exceeded my expectations.  We now have seven regular members, each of whom are serious, talented musicians, and who can collectively create energetic, quality, music.  While "semi-quiet, semi-acoustic" is still a viable approach to our gatherings, "loud and occasionally amazing" has become a real and fun alternative.

As we all know, Kevin H has been graciously providing primary PA support for us since the start of HSJ. He has supplied most of the equipment, most of the hauling, most of the setup, and most of the expertise.  As we have grown to seven people, the demands on the PA system (and thus on Kevin) have increased, and we are now cobbling together a kind of "frankenstein" system. With seven people and a full drum kit, it is common for me to not be able to hear either my vocals or my guitar. It is rare that I can hear all seven musicians clearly. In addition, the PA is a depreciating resource. We’ve been using it for two years, and we have incurred wear and tear on it. The current PA is in need of service.

For the long-term viability of HSJ, I think at least a couple of things need to happen. First, the overhead on Kevin H of PA setup, teardown, and management needs to decrease at least a little. Second, we need to have a PA system which enables us to hear each other at our current size.

One solution is to outsource the PA entirely to a sound system company. This would solve both problems, but at a cost of $300-$500 per jam if not more. Having to always "pay to play" might introduce new, potentially harmful dynamics into what has been up to now a pretty drama-free experience. 

A second solution is to upgrade, and thereby simplify, our PA by acquiring a digital mixer along with powered monitors. Kevin has done a little initial research and believes that a (new) digital mixer sufficient for our needs is probably around $3000. Perhaps we can find a used one for less.  Upgrading the PA in this way will mean less stuff to haul, less complexity during setup, and way easier mixing. Such a mixer will also greatly improve our experience as musicians because it will enable multiple independent monitor mixes.  We might actually be able to hear ourselves and each other.

A problem with the second solution is how to make the economics work. I’ve had negative experiences in the past where equipment was jointly owned by all members of the band. I would prefer to avoid a scenario where we feel compelled to push for money at every gig. So here’s a thought. Let’s say that Kevin and I jointly invested in a new mixer (and potentially monitors). Then, in future, in the event that we do take a paying gig, part of the revenue would be returned to Kevin and I as "rent" for the PA system, and the remainder split among the musicians equally. The goal would be for Kevin and I to eventually get back a third or a half of our investment over the next few years.

So far, HSJ has kept the fun high and the drama low.  I really want to keep it that way and, if possible, make it even better during the next two years. Figuring out a good solution to the PA problem is, I think, very important to achieving that goal. Please consider this and let us all know your thoughts.
