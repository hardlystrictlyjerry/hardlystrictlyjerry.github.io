Please RSVP to Kevin via email or text if you can come to the jam.

This month, we are experimenting with "Jam Notes", a collaboratively edited Google Doc where we can link to one or more "reference versions" of the songs, as well as sort out who is going to play what and when. The goal is to increase the fun of the jam by helping everyone get on the same page (or at least, same chapter) prior the jam.  Please go to [https://goo.gl/vHCRNy](https://goo.gl/vHCRNy) for the jam notes.
