<h1><img class="ui avatar image" src="/images/july4.jpg">Wave That Flag, Year 4</h1>

Hardly Strictly Jerry surfed in a jam on July 10 right between the fourth and fifth pandemic waves. It required a last minute change of venue, and an even more last minute change of date, but finally around 70 Dead-music starved folks convened at Michael Shapiro's for food, music, hot tubs, and fun. Oh, and a light show courtesy of Kevin Hughes!

Setlist: Sugar Magnolia, Bertha, Second that Emotion, Ramble on Rose, Gomorrah, My Sisters and Brothers, Loose Lucy, Althea, Jack Straw, Might as Well, The Golden Road (to unlimited devotion), Dancing in the Streets, Everybody Needs Somebody to Love, Scarlet Begonias, Fire on the Mountain, Black Peter, Eyes of the World, Sunshine Daydream, US Blues.
