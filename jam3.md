A note on this month's setlist:

  * Thomas expressed a preference for Beatles tunes, so the setlist includes two Beatles songs the Dead covered (Dear Prudence, Revolution), and two songs they didn't but folks suggested (Norwegian Wood, Get Back).
  * Since Justin is absent this month, Philip proposes that we defer PITB and China-Rider.

A note on HSJ setlists: 

  * I've discussed setlist heuristics with most everyone. While there is some variation in opinion, I think the general consensus is as follows:
  * The host should have significant input into the setlist as a reward and incentive for hosting. :)
  * Most people prefer a mixture of previously played and new tunes in the setlist each month.

Please RSVP to the text message list so Thomas has a (Dead) head count.
