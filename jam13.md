So, in a fit of January Post-Jam Euphoria, we agreed to do a set at Nikki Parlow's upcoming birthday party. After more than 100 text messages (95 of which were emojis sent by Kevin H), here are the organizational details to the extent we know them:

Rehearsal:  
  * Saturday, February 10
  * Michael and Andrea Shapiro's house. 
  * [1036 Lunaai Place, Kailua HI, 96734](http://maps.google.com/?q=1036%20Lunaai%20Place,%20Kailua HI,%2096734).

Setlist and Jam Notes:
  * There were many divergent opinions on the setlist.  The following Jam Notes link presents a proposed compromise between novelty, familiarity, non-repeatability, and danceability. See what you think.
