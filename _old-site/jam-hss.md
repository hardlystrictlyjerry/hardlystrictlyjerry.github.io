John Stallings invites the HSJ krewe to participate in a BBQ and jam session on Saturday, February 4, 2017.
 
Place: [112 S. Kalaheo Ave, Kailua, HI 96734](http://maps.google.com/?q=112%20S.%20Kalaheo%20Ave,%20Kailua,%20HI%2096734). 
See the [Invitation](https://goo.gl/qjs29A) for details. You can bring friends! Eat 5-6pm, Jam 6-8pm.

Based on your song requests, here's a proposal for a semi-organized jam session. The plan is three sets with different mixtures of musicians, followed by an open jam session where anyone plays whatever they want.  But the goal is fun, so feel free add, subtract, and totally disregard the following if you like.
 
Set One: Philip and Friends

* Larry, Philip, Michael, Doug, and/or others.
* Midnight Moonlight, Bertha, Everyday People, Don't Let Go, Sugaree, and/or others.

Set Two: Hardly Strictly Jeremy

* Michael, Larry, Jeremy, Kevin, and/or others.
* Tangled Up in Blue, Terrapin, Friend of the Devil, Eyes, Althea, and/or others.

Set Three: Old Speedway Boogie

* Larry, Jeremy, Boogie, Kevin, Doug, and/or others.
* Think of What You've Done, Panama Red, Positively 4th Street, Scarlet Begonias, I Scare Myself, and/or others.

Set Four: The Stallinators
