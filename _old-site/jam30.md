## New Years Eve

It was the party that almost wasn't!  Heidi came back from her trip with pneumonia, and so with two days to go, Kevin had to find a new location or cancel the party.  Fortunately, Candis Burton kindly stepped up and offered her farm in Waimanalo. HSJ hosted a surprise marriage proposal for the second time. This is apparently going to be a thing.

Setlist: Box of Rain, New Minglewood Blues, Mississippi Half Step, Hard to Handle, West LA Fadeaway, Jack Straw, Deal, Shining Star, Franklin's Tower, Playin in the Band, Throwing Stones, Not Fade Away, St. Stephen, PITB Reprise, Good Lovin', Sugar Magnolia.
