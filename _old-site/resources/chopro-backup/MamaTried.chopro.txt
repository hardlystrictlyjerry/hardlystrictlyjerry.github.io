{t:Mama Tried}
{st:Merle Haggard}

{C: D / G / % / A / / / }

The first thing I remember knowing,
Was a lonesome whistle blowing,
And a young un's dream of growing up to ride,
On a freight train leaving town,
Not knowing where I'm bound,
And no one could change my mind but Mama tried

Was the only rebel child,
From a family, meek and mild,
My Mama seemed to know what lay in store
Despite all my Sunday learning,
Towards the bad, I kept turning
'Til Mama couldn't hold me anymore

{c: D /// | C / D / | Bm /// | A /// }

I turned 21 in prison doing life without parole.
No one could steer me right but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading, I denied
That leaves only me to blame 'cause Mama tried

Dear old Daddy, rest his soul,
Left my Mom a heavy load,
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest,
Wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right but I refused

(Chorus)
