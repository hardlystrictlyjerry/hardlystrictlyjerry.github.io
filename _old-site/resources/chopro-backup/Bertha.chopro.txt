I had a hard run, running from your window.
I was all night running, Lord I wonder if you care,
I had a run in, run around in a run down.
Run around the corner, corner, Lord I ran smack into a tree.

{c: Chorus: D / Am / G / C D / C / G / D / C / Am / C / G}
I had to move, really had to move,
That's why if you please, I am on my bended knees,
Bertha don't you come around here anymore.

Dressed myself in green, I went down into the sea.
Try to see what's going down, try to read between the lines.
I had a feelin' I was fallin', I turned around to see,
Heard a voice a callin', Lord you was coming after me.

(Chorus)

Vox on second time for chorus:

Ran into a rainstorm, I ducked back into a bar door.
It's all night pouring but not a drop on me.
(Accent 2nd) Test me, test me, why don't you arrest me?
(Accent 4th) Throw me in the jailhouse until the sun goes down.

Chorus: ... Anymore X 10
