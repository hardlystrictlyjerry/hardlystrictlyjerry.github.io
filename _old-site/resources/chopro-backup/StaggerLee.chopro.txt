1940, Xmas eve, with a full moon over town
F       C       Bb      F
Stagger Lee met Billy DeLion
       Bb
And he blew that poor boy down.
F      C            Bb       F
Do you know what he shot him for?
     Bb                   (a# a g#)
What do you make of that?
      G
Cause Billy DeLion threw lucky dice
    A
Won Stagger Lee's Stetson hat.

Bayou, Bayou, tell me how can this be?
      G                  C       G
You arrest the girls for turning tricks
                     C       D   C
But you're scared of Stagger Lee.
G                C  G                  C     D
Stagger Lee is a madman and he shot my Billy D.
C            G      C               D   (C G C D)
Bayou go get him or give the job to me.

Delia Delion, oh sweet Delia-D
How the hell can I arrest him? He's twice as big as me.
Don't ask me to go downtown, I won't come back alive.
Not only is that mother big he packs a .45

(Head)
Bayou, Delia said, just give me your gun
He shot my Billy dead now I'm gonna see him hung.
She went into the DeLion's club through Billy DeLionâ€™s blood
Stepped up to Stagger Lee at the bar,
Said, "Buy me a gin fizz, love."

(Solo over C-G part x 2)

As Stagger Lee lit a cigarette she shot him in the balls
Blew the smoke off her revolver, had him dragged to city hall
Bayou, Bayou, see you hang him high
He shot my Billy dead and now he's got to die.

Delia went a walking down on Singapore Street
A three-piece band on the corner played "Near My God to Thee"
But Delia whistled a different tune, what tune could it be?
The song that woman sung was "Look Out Stagger Lee".
The song that Delia sung was "Look Out Stagger Lee".
