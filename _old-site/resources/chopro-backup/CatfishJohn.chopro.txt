A                  D
Mama said don't go near that river 
A                                   E
Don't be hanging around old Catfish John
A                        D
But come the morning I'd always be there
A                               E           A
Walking in his footsteps in the sweet delta dawn

        D                A
Take me back, to another moment
     D             A
To a time, so long ago
         D                A
When the sweet, magnolias blossomed 
           A      E               A
The cotton fields,  were white as snow

Catfish John was a river hobo
He lived and died, by the rivers bend
Looking back, I still remember
I was proud,   to be his friend

Born a slave, in the town of Vicksburg 
Traded for, a chestnut mare
Lord he never, spoke in anger
Though his load,  was hard to bare

Mama said don't go near that river 
Don't be hanging around old Catfish John
But come the morning I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the sweet delta dawn
Walking in his footsteps in the sweet delta dawn
