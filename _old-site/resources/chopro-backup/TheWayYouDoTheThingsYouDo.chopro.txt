{t:The Way You Do The Things You Do}
{st: The Temptations}

{c: C | F | G }

You got a smile so bright
You know you could have been a candle
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could have been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet
You know you could've been a broom
The way you smell so sweet
You know you could've been some perfume

Well you could've been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell the way you do the things you do

As pretty as you are
You know you could've been a flower
If good looks were minutes
You know that you could be an hour
The way you stole my heart
You know you could have been a cool crook
And baby you're so smart
You know you could have been a school book

(Chorus)

(Lead = Verse)

(Chorus)

You make my life so rich
You know you could've been some money
And baby you're so sweet
You know you could have been some honey

(Chorus, repeat TWYDTTYD a few times)

(Jam in C7)

(Repeat V3, Chorus, repeat TWYDTTYD a couple of times)

(Instrumental fade out)
