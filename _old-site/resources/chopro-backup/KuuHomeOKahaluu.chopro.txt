{t:Kuu Home O Kahaluu}
{st: Jerry Santos}

I remember days when we were younger
We used to catch 'o'opu in the mountain stream
'Round the Ko'olau hills we'd ride on horseback
So long ago it seems it was a dream
Last night I dreamt I was returning
And my heart called out to you
But I fear you won't be like I left you
Me kealoha ku'u home o Kahaluu

I remember days when we were wiser
When our world was small enough for dreams
And you have lingered there my sister
And I no longer can it seems
Last night I dreamt I was returning
And my heart called out to you
But I fear I won't be like I left you
Me kealoha ku'u home o Kahaluu

Change is a strange thing
It cannot be denied
It can help you find yourself
Or make you lose your pride
Move with it slowly
As on the road we go
Please do not hold on to me
We all must go alone

I remember days when we were smiling
When we laughed and sang the whole night long
And I will greet you as I find you
With the sharing of a brand new song
Last night I dreamt I was returning
And my heart called out to you
To please accept me as you'll find me
Me kealoha ku'u home o Kahaluu
