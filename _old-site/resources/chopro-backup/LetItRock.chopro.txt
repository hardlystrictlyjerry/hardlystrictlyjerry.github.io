Way up in the evening, down in Mobile, Alabama
Working on the railroad with a steel driving hammer
Got to make some money, buy some brand new shoes
Try to find somebody take away these blues
She don't love me here, I'm singing in the sun
Payday's coming and my work is all done

Early in the evening when the sun is sinking low
All day I've been waiting for the whistle to blow
Sitting in a teepee built right on the track
Rolling them bones 'till the foreman come back
Pick up your belongings boys and scatter about
We got an off scheduled train coming two miles out

Everybody's scrambling and running around
Picking up the money, tear the teeppee down
Foreman was in panic, 'bout to go insane
Trying to get the workers out the way of the train
Engineer blowing the whistle loud and long
Can't stop the train we got to let it roll on
