{t:Tell the Truth}
{st:Eric Clapton}

Tell me who's been fooling you?
Tell the truth, Now who's been fooling who?

There you sit there, looking so cool
While the whole show is passing you by
You better come to terms with your fellow men soon, 'cause

The whole world is shaking now, I can feel it
A new dawn is breaking now, I can see it

Tell the truth, Tell me who's been fooling you
Tell the truth, Now who's been fooling who?

It doesn't matter who you are
Or where you're gonna be
Open your eyes and look into your heart

The whole world is shaking now, I can feel it
A new dawn is breaking now, I can see it
See it, yeah, I can see it, See it, yeah, I can see it

Tell the truth, Tell me who's been fooling you
Tell the truth, Who's been fooling who?

Hear what I say, 'cause every word is true
You know I wouldn't tell you no lies
Your time's coming, is gonna be soon, boy

The whole world is shaking now, I can feel it?
A new dawn is breaking now, I can see it?
See it, yeah, I can see it
See it, yeah, I can see it
I can see it
See it, yeah, I can see it
