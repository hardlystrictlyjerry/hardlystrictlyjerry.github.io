I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me
She showed me her room, isn't it good, norwegian wood?

{c: Dm | G | Dm | Em7 | A7 }

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on the rug, drinking her wine, biding my time
We talked until two and then she said, "It's time for bed"

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isn't it good, norwegian wood?
