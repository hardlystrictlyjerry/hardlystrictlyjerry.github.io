Well now baby used to stay out all night long,
Made me cry, Lord she done me wrong.
Hurt my eyes open, and that's no lie,
Tables turning, now it's her turn to cry,

{c: || D    C     G     :||}

Cuz I used to love her, but it's all over now.
Cuz I used to love her, but it's all over now.

Well I used to wake up in the morning, get my breakfast in bed,
When I got worried, you know she eased my aching head,
But now she's here and there with every man in town,
Still trying to take me for that same old clown.

Well she used to run around with every man in town,
Spend all my money, Lord I'm playing her half-ass game
Put me out, it was a pity how I cried,
Table's turnin', now it's her turn to cry,
