{t:Turn on your lovelight}
{st:Grateful Dead}

{c: E / A}

Without a warning, you broke my heart, takin' it baby, tore it apart
And you left me standin' in the dark cryin', said your love for me was dyin'.
Come on baby, baby please. I'm begging you baby, cause I'm on my knees.

Turn on your light. Let it shine on me. Turn on your love light
Let it shine on me. Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

When I get lonely in the middle of the night
And I need you darlin' to make things alright
So come on baby, baby please
And I'm beggin' you baby cause I'm on my knees,

Turn on your light, let it shine on me. Turn on your love light,
Let it shine on me. Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.
Little bit higher, little bit higher!
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
