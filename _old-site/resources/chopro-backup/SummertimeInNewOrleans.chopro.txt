{t:Summertime in New Orleans}
{st:Anders Osborne}

[C]On a front stoop of my house, [F]watching [G]folks go [C]by.
[C]Lazy days, chewing on ice, just [F]waiting [F/F#] on [G]July.
[F]And O[G]Z plays [C]Irma [Am]Thomas and [F]we all [G]know what that [C]means.
[C]Rag-a-tag of rain, city's so slow, [F]it's summertime in [G]New [C]Orleans.

All my friends getting drunk on Sunday, they're just trying to keep cool.
I'm hanging out with these fools playing card games and my new best friend who's got a pool.
And OZ plays James Andrews and we all know who dat is.
Rag-a-tag of rain, city's so slow, it's summertime in New Orleans.

Gallons of daquiries, snowball in the cone, slow drive by the lake,
Doing 35 through all the school zones and my new AC unit just broke,
And OZ plays Kermit Ruffins, he's barbequing up at Vaughns
Rag-a-tag of rain, smoking a joe, it's summertime in New Orleans.

{soc:}
[Cdim7]The garbage truck just [G]passed you up, and that [G/G#]potent smell of [C]seafood [Am]shells
[F]Sweet [F/F#]blooming [C]magnolia [Am]tree, [F]That's summertime in [G]New [C]Orleans
{eoc:}

Taking a buggy ride with my wife through the quarter, listening to Tuba Fats
Little kids keep splashing water, in the gutter, next to the gentlemen with straw hats
And OZ plays Satchmo-baby, we all know who that is,
Rag-a-tag of rain, city's so slow, it's summertime in New Orleans.
Rag-a-tag of rain, city's so low, it's summertime in New Orleans.
