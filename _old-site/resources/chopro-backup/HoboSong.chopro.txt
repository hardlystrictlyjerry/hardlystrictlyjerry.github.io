{t:Hobo Song}
{st:Old and in the Way}

[G]Too late to feel [Em]sorrow, [C]too late to feel [Am]pain
[F]He's just an old hobo [Am]And he's lost out in the [G]rain

[G]He'll never cause [Em]trouble [C]so don't have no [Am]fear
[F]He's just an old hobo [G]and he'll soon be far away from here

{c:Chorus}

[B7]He used to be a gambling man [C]just like you [Cm]
[Cm]Until he [G]sank so low that there was
[D]Nothing that no one could [G]do

[B7]He used to be a gambling man [C]just like you [Cm]
[Cm]Until he [G]sank so low that there was
[D]Nothing that no one could [G]do

Oh, don't make him ask you, don't make him beg
He was a war hero and that's how he hurt his leg
He killed thirty injuns with one cannon ball
Now he's just an old hobo asleep out in the hall

My wife and five children who live in L.A.
They miss their dear daddy who's gone so far away
They still have his picture, it's hung on the wall
Now he's just an old hobo asleep out in the hall
