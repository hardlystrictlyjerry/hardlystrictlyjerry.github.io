{t:Fishing Blues}
{st:Taj Mahal}

I betcha' going fishing all of the time
And my baby going fishing too
You can bet you life, your sweet wife
Is gonna catch more fish than you

Many fish bites if you got good bait
Here's a little story I would like to relate
Many fish bites if you got good bait,
I'm a going fishin', yes I'm going fishin'
And my baby's going fishin' too

Baby Jenna about to run me up outta my mind
Saying "Can I go fishin' with you?"
So I took her on down to my favorite fishin' hole
Now what do you think baby Jenna did do?

She pulled a great big fish 
Out of the bottom yes she caught him
She laughed and jumped she was real gone
Many fish bites if you got good bait
I'm a goin' fishin', yes I'm goin' fishin'
And my baby goin' fishin' too

Put him in the pot, baby put him in the pan
And cook him till he's nice an' brown
Get yourself some butter and some hot cakes mama
And you put it on the table and you eat it on down

Singing many fish bites if you got good bait
Here's a little story that I would like to relate
Many fish bites if you got good bait
I'm a goin' fishin',
yes I'm goin' fishin',
Katie's going fishing,
Momma's going fishing,
And Jenna's going fishing too.
