[B]Sunshine [E]day[B]dream,
[F#]walking in the [E]tall [B]trees
Going where the wind blows,
Blooming like a red rose
Breathing more freely,
Ride out singing I'll walking you in the morning sunshine,
Sunshine daydream

Sunshine, daydream, Now come on over daydream
Sunshine, daydream. Hey come on, Never gonna sweet dream
Sunshine, daydream, Wading in a cold stream.

Say calling out your window, "Wake Up!"
Going where the wind goes, Never gonna miss that, No no no!
Ride out singin', "I got you in the morning sunshine."

Sunshine, daydream, (Hey) Street coming daydream
Hey, hey, I'm moving on a daydream, (Hey)
Hey, Sweet coming daydream, (Hey)

Sun coming daydream, Come on over daydream,
Come on over, Come on over daydream,
Sweet coming daydream, Hey, never fade away dream,
Yea, Hey hey, Sweet coming daydream, Never fade away dream
