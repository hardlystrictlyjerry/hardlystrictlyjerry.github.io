E                            A/E         E          A   
Sunrise doesn't last all morning
E    A/E                         E       A
A cloudburst doesn't last all day
E                  A/E                               E                
       A
It seems my love is up and has left you with no warning
E              A/E                E     A
It's not always gonna be this grey

Bm                          A      Asus4    A
All things must pass
E                             A/E       E     A/E  E(2)  A
All things must pass away

Sunset doesn't last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this my love is up and must be leaving
It's not always gonna be this grey       

Bm                          A     Asus4    A
All things must pass
Bm                                          A     Asus4    A
None of life's strings can last
       E               A/E
So I must be on my way
      E       A
To face another day


Now the darkness only stays the nighttime
In the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good at arriving at the right time
It's not always gonna be this grey        

Bm                         A
All things must pass
 E                           A/E    E
All things must pass away
