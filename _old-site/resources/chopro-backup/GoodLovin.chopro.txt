I was feeling, so bad,
I asked my family doctor about what I had.

I said, Doctor (Doctor), Mister MD (Doctor),
Can you tell me (Doctor) what's ailing me?

He said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All you need, all you really need, is Good lovin'

So come on baby, squeeze me tight
Don't you want your daddy to be alright?
I said baby (baby), now it's for sure (baby),
I've got the fever, (baby) you got the cure.

He said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All you need, all you really need: Good lovin'

(Guitar Solo 2x around complete verse and chorus)

(Repeat first verse and chorus)

(Vocal scat over alternating "Got to have lovin" and "Got to have Good Love")

(Bobby cues end: Repeat Head with quick drum break ending)
