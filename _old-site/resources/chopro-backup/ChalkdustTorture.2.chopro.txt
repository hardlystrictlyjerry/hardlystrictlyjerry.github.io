{t: Chalkdust Torture}
{st: Phish}

    E7                       A
Come stumble my mirth beaten worker
                             E7
I'm Jezmund the family berzerker
   E7                        A
I'm bought for the price of a flagon of rice
The wind buffs the cabin, you speak of your life
                            E7
Or more willingly Locust the Lurker

Confuse what you can of the ending
And revise your despise so impending
'Cause I soak on the wrath that you didn't quite mask
I'm getting it clearly through alternate paths
Or mixed in with the signal you're sending

   G                       A
But who can unlearn all the facts that I've learned
    G                          E7
As I sat in their chairs 'til my synapses burned
       G                        A
And the torture of chalk dust collects on my tongue
G                             A
Thoughts follow my vision and dance in the sun
      G                          A
All my vasoconstrictors they come slowly undone
          G
Can't this wait till I'm old?
{c: main riff}
Can't I live while I'm young?
Can't I live while I'm young?

But no peace for Jezmund tonight
I plug the distress tube up tight
And watch what I say as it flutters away
And all this emotion is kept harmless at bay
Not to educate somebody's fright
