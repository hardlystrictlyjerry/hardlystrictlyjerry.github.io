The judge decreed it, the clerk he wrote it.
Clerk he wrote it down indeed-e
Judge decreed it, clerk he wrote it down
Give you this jail sentence you'll be Nashville bound

Some got six months some got one solid.
Some got one solid year indeed-e
Some got six months some got one solid year.
But me and my buddies all got lifetime here!

I wrote a letter I mailed in the,
Mailed it on the air indeed-e
I wrote a letter I mailed in the air.
You may know by that I've got a friend somewhere.
