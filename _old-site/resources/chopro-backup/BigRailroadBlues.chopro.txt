{t:Big Railroad Blues}
{st:Grateful Dead}

Well my mama told me, my papa told me too,
Now my mama told me, papa told me too,
Well I shouldn't be here tryin' to sing these railroad blues.

Wish I had a'listened to what my mama said,
Wish I had a'listened to what my mama said,
Well I wouldn't be here tryin' to sleep in this cold iron bed.

[Chorus]
[Lead 3 rounds]

Well I went to the depot, I never got there on time,
Went down to the depot, never got there on time.
Well my train done left, she's a rollin' down the line.

Mister jailer go away now, don't tell me no lie,
Mister jailer go away, don't tell me no lie,
When the train's going down, she's rollin' down the line.

[Lead (Multi Rounds)]

Wish I had a'listened to what my mama said,
Wish I had a'listened to what my mama said,
Well I wouldn't be here tryin' to sleep in this cold iron bed.

[Chorus}
