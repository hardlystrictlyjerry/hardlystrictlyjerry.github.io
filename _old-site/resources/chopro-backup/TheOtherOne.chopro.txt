{t: The Other One}
{st: Grateful Dead}

E
Spanish lady come to me,
She lays on me this rose.

E         D

E
It rainbow spirals round and round
Then trembles and explodes.

E         D

E
It left a smoking crater of my mind
I like to blow away.

E         D

E
But the heat came 'round and busted me
For smiling on a cloudy day.

E               E  D   C   A             G
Comin', comin', comin' around, comin', around,
E  D    C  A         G  A
comin', around, in a circle

Comin', comin', comin' around, comin', around,
comin', around, in a circle

Skippin' through the lily fields
I came across an empty space,
It trembled and exploded,
Left a bus stop in it's place.
The bus came by and I got on,
That's when it all began,
There was cowboy Neal at the wheel
Of the bus to never ever land.

Comin', comin', comin' around, comin', around,
comin', around, in a circle
Comin', comin', comin' around, comin', around,
comin', around, in a circle
