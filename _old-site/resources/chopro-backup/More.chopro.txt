{c: Phish's is in A, this is transposed to G }

G                    F
Life in slow motion, feet are in the clay
    C
I'm going nowhere, been standing here all day
G                        F
I had a notion, there was something more to do
     C
As I watched the water, from the banks of the river it swelled and grew
      G                                    D
And I tilt to the left, lean to the right, tilt to the left and lean to the right
F                                       C
Walked on coal and slept on glass, amid swords of sound and daggers of light
       G        D
And my heart is screaming,
      F                                  C
cause half of what I say is lies, and it takes so much to keep up this disguise
G         F         C
                   It takes so much to keep up this disguise

        G                                        D
I see a doorway in the haze and I'm trying to get to it
    F                                            C
The stars are peepholes in a wall but we can walk through it
    G                           D
The memory is still so real, the memory's still so real
             F                               C
I guess it's never really over even when it's over

{c: Chorus:}
        G                              F
But I'm vibrating with love and light, pulsating with love and light
     C
in a world gone mad, a world gone mad, there must be something more than this
    G                              F
I'm vibrating with love and light, pulsating with love and light
     C
in a world gone mad, a world gone mad, there must be something more than this

    G                             D
The trumpet call is sounding, the trees are bending low
          F                                 C
There's a great fire in the distance, there must be something more than this
        G                                 D
And our shadows will all be dancing, with red dust on our clothes
          F                 C
And we'll leave by tornado, elbows in the clouds and feet in the sky

{c: Chorus}

G          D           F                C
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh, woah ohhh ohh ohh ohhh ohhh  (x2)

{c: Chorus}
