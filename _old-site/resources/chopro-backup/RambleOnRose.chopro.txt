{t:Ramble On Rose}

{c: || D    E    F#m    G    D    D    G    A :|| }

Just like Jack the Ripper, just like Mojo Hand,
Just like Billy Sunday in a shotgun ragtime band,
Just like New York City, just like Jerico,
Pace the halls and climb the walls and get out when they blow.

{c: D    G    E    G     D    A    D }

Did you say your name was Ramblin Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy, Ramble on Rose.

Just like Jack and Jill, Mama told the jailor
One heat up and one cool down and leave nothing for the tailor.
Just like Jack and Jill, Papa told the jailer
One go up, and one go down, do yourself a favor.

Did you say your name was Ramblin Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy, Ramble on Rose.

{c: Bm    C    Bm    C    G }

I'm gonna to sing you a hundred verses in ragtime,
I know this song it ain't never gonna end.

{c: Bm    C    D     A    Bm    E   A } 

I'm gonna march you up and down along the county line,
Take you to the leader of the band.

Just like Crazy Otto, just like Wolfman Jack,
Sittin plush with a royal flush, aces back to back.
Just like Mary Shelly, just like Frankenstein,
Clank your chains and count your change and try to walk the line.

Goodbye Mama and Papa, goodbye Jack and Jill.
The grass ain't greener, the wine ain't sweeter
Either side of the hill.
