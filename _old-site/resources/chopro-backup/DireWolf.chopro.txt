{t:Dire Wolf}
{st:Grateful Dead}

[G]In the timbers of Fennario, the [Bb]wolves are running [F]round,
[F]The winter was so hard and cold, froze ten feet 'neath the [G]ground.
[G]Don't murder [F]me, [G]I beg of [C]you don't [Bb]murder [F]me.
[G]Please [F]don't murder [C]me.

[G]I sat down to my supper, [Bb]twas a bottle of red whis[F]key.
[F]I said my prayers and went to bed, that's the [C]last they saw of [Am]me.
[Am]Don't murder [G]me, [F]I beg of [C]you don't [Bb]murder [F]me.
[G]Pleas[F]e don't murder [C]me.

[Am]When I awoke, the [G]dire wolf, six [C]hundred [Bb]pounds of [F]sin,
[F]Was grinnin' at my window, all I said was "Come on [G]in"
[G]Don't murder [F]me, [G]I beg of [C]you don't [E7]murder [Am]me,
[G]Pleas[F]e don't murder [C]me.

[Am]The wolf came in, I [G]got my cards, we [C]sat down [Bm]for a [F]game.
[F]I cut my deck to the queen of spades but the cards were all the [G]same.
Don't murder me, I beg of you don't murder me.
Please don't murder me.

In the backwash of Fennario, the black and bloody mire,
The dire wolf collects his due while the boys sing 'round the fire.
Don't murder me, I beg of you don't murder me.
Please don't murder me.
