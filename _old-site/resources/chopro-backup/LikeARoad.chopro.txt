When the road gets too hard, And you run all out of songs
And the pain gets too much for you to bear
Turn around, turn around, turn around and I'll be there
Like a road, like a road leading home.

When the grey clouds start to blow, And you want somewhere to go
And you need some company that really cares
Turn around, turn around, turn around and I'll be there
Like a road, like a road leading home.

When you feel so down and low, And the road your travelling on
Doesn't seem to be going anywhere
Turn around, turn around, turn around and I'll be there
Like a road, like a road leading home.

When you wake up feeling low, And you want somewhere to go
And you need some company that really cares
Turn around, turn around, turn around and I'll be there
Like a road, like a road leading home.
Like a road, like a road leading home.
