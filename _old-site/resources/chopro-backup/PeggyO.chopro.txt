{t:Peggy-O}
{st:Grateful Dead}

As we rode out to Fennario. (x2)
Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove,
And called her by name, pretty Peggy-O.

Will you marry me pretty Peggy-O? (x2)
If you will marry me, I'll set your cities free,
And free all the ladies in the are-O.

I would marry you sweet William-O. (x2)
I would marry you but your guineas are too few,
And I fear my mama would be angry-O.

What would your mama think pretty Peggy-O? (x2)
What would your mama think if she heard my guineas clink.
Saw me marching at the head of my soldiers-O.

(Lead)

If ever I return pretty Peggy-O, (x2)
If ever I return your cities I will burn,
Destroy all the ladies in the area-O.

Come steppin' down the stairs pretty Peggy-O, (x2)
Come steppin' down the stairs combing back your yellow hair,
Bid a last farewell to your William-O

Sweet William he is dead pretty Peggy-O, (x2)
Sweet William he is dead and he died for a maid,
And he's buried in the Louisiana country-O.

As we rode out to Fennario. (x2)
Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove,
And called her by name, pretty Peggy-O.
