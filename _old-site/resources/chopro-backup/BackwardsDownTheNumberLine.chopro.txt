{c: intro: |  G  |   G  | }

C                 G
Happy happy oh my friend
                 D
Blow out candles once again
                   Em
Leave the presents all inside
Em    D   C              G
Take  my  hand and letâ€™s take a ride
                   D           Dsus   D
Backwards down the number line
                         Em
You were eight and I was nine
                          D
Do you know what happened then?
(A)(B) C
        Do you know why we're still friends
                        G
Laughing all these many years
                            D
We pushed through hardships tasted tears
               Em
Made a promise one to keep
Em D C                      G
      I can still recite it in my sleep
             D                Dsus   D
Every time a birthday comes
                            Em
Call your friend and sing a song
           D    C
Or whisper it into his ear
                                    G
Or write it down, just don't miss a year


{c: Chorus 1: (played 4x through)}
    F              C                                   G
You decide what it contains, How long it goes but this remains
         F          C                         G
The only rule is it begins, Happy happy oh my friend

{c: Chorus 2: (play 2x, starting after the 2nd time through "Chorus 1" above)}
    F      C                               G
And all my friends come backwards down the number line x3

{c: Bridge: Em  D  C  Em  D  C}

Bm                        C
And when I see you coming down the line with eyes wide open
Bm                                C
Somewhere in between the past and future, where you drift in time
                        D        G
You can see a different point of view

{c: Repeat Chorus 2x}
