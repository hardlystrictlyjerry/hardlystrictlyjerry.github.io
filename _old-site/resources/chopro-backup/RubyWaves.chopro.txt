{t:Ruby Waves}
{st: Trey Anastasio}

A
Blue morning, walking down the street
G                        D
Hear the rhythm from the soles of my feet
A
On the pavement, and I reach out my hands
G                             D
And touch the building that's beside me
      A
And I look into the air up above my head
G                           D
Thin layer of clouds and the open sky
A
All the stars are handles on doors
          G
If I could touch 'em with my fingers
            D
They would open up


A                                         G               D
And a sea of love, ruby waves would pour down on my head
A
An ocean of love would carry me
G                       D
Up from this prison of lies
A
If I could touch the stars with my fingertip
     G                           D
The doors would open all around me
      A                                    G
Could escape from this prison of lies and swim
                 D
In the ocean up above my head

{c: Repeat intro}

A                          G             D
When I die I'll turn into a tiny ball of energy
A                                                 G     D
And I'll go flipping and floating up into the sky
A
And bounce off the stars like a pinball machine
G              D
Look around
A
All the lights on the machine are flashing
G                            D
'Til they explode and the particles join up with

{c: Chorus}

A
Could escape from this prison of lies (x2)
