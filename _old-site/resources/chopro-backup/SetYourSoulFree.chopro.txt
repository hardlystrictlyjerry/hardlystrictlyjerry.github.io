{t: Set your soul free}
{st: Phish}

A         B     A               B
Trying to share, what it's all about
Let the music do the talking, it'll help you out
Stay up for days, don't get down
Roll with the funk now, turn it around

{c: Chorus:}
B                           A
Burn it down, burn it down, set your soul free
We're all here together in a spirit family
Everybody's dancing, everyone can see
Burn it down, burn it down, set your soul free
              B
Set your soul free

On the go, I'm singing this song
They're digging my grave, and it won't be long
So take a little trip, feel a little rain
Aim a little higher, and try to ignore the pain
