{t:Box of Rain}

{c: Intro: A Bm7 A Asus4 }

[D]Look out of [Am]any window, [Em]any morning, [C]any evening, any [G]day
[D]Maybe the [Am]sun is shining, [Em]birds are winging or [G]rain is falling from a [A]heavy sky
[D]What do you [G]want me to do, [Am]to do for you to [Em]see you [D]through?
For [C]this is all a [D]dream we dreamed one [Am]afternoon long [G]ago

Walk out of any doorway, feel your way, feel your way like the day before
Maybe you'll find direction around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you
What do you want me to do, to watch for you while you're sleeping?
Then [Am]please don't be sur[C]prised when you [G]find me dreaming [D]too.

{c: Lead: G Am Em / C A D / G  Am Em / C D Em A Asus A }

Look into any eyes you find by you, you can see clear through to another day
Maybe been seen before through other eyes on other days while going home
What do you want me to do, to do for you to see you through?
It's [C]all a dream we [Em]dreamed one after[D]noon long [G]ago.

Walk into splintered sunlight Inch your way through dead dreams to another land
Maybe you're tired and broken, your tongue is twisted with words half spoken and thoughts unclear
What do you want me to do to do for you to see you through? 
A  [Am]box of rain will [C]ease the pain and [G]love will see you [D]through.

[G]Just a box of rain,  [Am]wind and [Em]water, 
[C]Believe it if you [Am]need it, if you [D]don't just pass it on.
[G]Sun and shower, [Am]wind and [Em]rain, 
[C]In and out the [D]window like a [Em]moth before a [A]flame.

And it's [D]just a box of [Em]rain, I don't [G]know who put it [D]there
Believe it if you [Bm]need it, or [G]leave it if you [A]dare.
And it's [D]just a box of [Em]rain or a [G]ribbon for your [D]hair
Such a [Em]long long time to be gone and a [G]short time to be [D]there.
