{st:Jerry Garcia}

Hey Valerie, Baby what's the matter with you?
I did all the things that you wanted me to.
I went downtown with my pocket knife,
Cut your other man, but I spared his life.
Valerie won't you be good to me?

Hey Valerie, Baby what's the matter with you?
Come on, come Baby, and tell me true.
Hey now Baby, what did I do?
I shot my dog 'cause he growled at you.
Valerie won't you be good to me?

Valerie what's the matter with me?
I never ever done you no wrong.
I sing the blues nearly all night long.
Valerie what the matter with me?
You know I'd do anything that you'd say
I can't understand why you tell me "Please go away"

{c: Lead = Verse }

I ain't afraid of the cold, cruel world outside,
No chicken little running from a falling sky.
The only thing trouble's me is you.
If you leave me what will I do?
Valerie won't you be good to me?

You got me down on the knees of my shaking feet.
Can't play the blues 'cause for you I drop the beat
Valerie what your complaint?
I try to be everything I ain't.
Valerie won't you be good to me? (x3)
