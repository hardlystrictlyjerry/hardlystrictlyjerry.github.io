Great North Special, were you all board? You can't find a ride like that no more
Night the chariot swung down low. Ninety-nine children had a chance to go.
One long party from front to end, tune to the whistle going round the bend.
No big hurry, what do you say? Might as well travel the elegant way.

(Chorus)

Ragtime slowly for twenty-five miles. Then switch over to the Cajun style.
Bar car loaded with rhythm and blues. Rock 'n' roll wailing in the old caboose.
Long train running from coast to coast, Bringing 'long the party where they need it the most
Whup on the box car, beat on the bell, Nothing else shaking so you might just as well.

(Chorus)

Never had such a good time in my life before, I'd like to have it one time more,

{c: |F/ D/|G/ E /| Am / Bb /| F/// | //F# / |G///| % |}
One good ride from start to end, I'd like to take that ride again, again!

(Lead: Verse + Chorus)

Ran out of track and I caught the plane. Back in the county with the blues again.
Great North Special been on my mind, I might like to ride it just one more time.

(Chorus -> Chorus and End)
