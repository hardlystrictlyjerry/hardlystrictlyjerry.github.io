{t:Midnight Moonlight}
{st:Old and in the Way}

[G]If you ever feel lonesome [D]and you're down in San Antone
[Am]Beg, steal, or [D]borrow two nickels or a [C]dime and call me on the [F]phone

[G]I'll meet you at Alamo Mission [D]where we can say our prayers
[Am]The Holy Ghost and the [D]Virgin Mother will heal us [Em]as we [D]kneel [C]there

{c:Chorus}

[F]In the moonlight, [C]In the midnight,
[F]In the moonlight [C]midnight moon[F]light
[F]In the moonlight, [C]In the midnight,
[F]In the moonlight [C]midnight moon[G]light

If you ever feel sorrow for the deeds you have done
With no hope for tomorrow in the setting of the sun
And the ocean is howling for the things that might have been
Well that last good morning sunrise
Will be the brightest you've ever seen.
