{t:Waste}
{st:Phish}

(KR alone, then Boogie, then Philip with vocals)

{c: |: D   Dmaj7  D7  |   G   Gm   D  :|}
Don't want to be an actor, pretending on the stage
Don't want to be a writer, with my thoughts out on the page
Don't want to be a painter, 'cause everyone comes to look
Don't want to be anything where my life's an open book

{c: |:  G    Gm     D   :| }
A dream, it's true, but I'd see it through.
If I could be (if I could be) wasting my time with you.

Don't want to be a farmer, working in the sun,
Don't want to be an outlaw, always on the run,
Don't want to be a climber, reaching for the top,
Don't want to be anything where I don't know when to stop.

A dream, it's true but I'd see it through.
If I could be (if I could be) wasting my time with you.

{c: |: F    C    G     D   :| }
So if I'm inside your head, don't believe what you might have read,
You'll see what I might have said, to hear it
{c: |:   G     Am    C  :| }
Come waste your time with me  (X4)

(D descending riff 2x  while Boogie solos)

So if I'm inside your head, don't believe what you might have read,
You'll see what I might have said, to hear it
Come waste your time with me (x3)
Come waste!

(Bluegrass break)
