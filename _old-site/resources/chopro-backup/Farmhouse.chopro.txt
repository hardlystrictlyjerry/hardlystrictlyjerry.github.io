C       G         Am                F              C
Welcome this is a farmhouse we have cluster flies alas
    G            C       G
And this time of year is bad
C      G       Am                 F             C
We are so very sorry, but there's little we can do
    G        C  G
But swat them

Am                 G/B
She didn't beg oh, not enough
C                    F
She didn't stay when things got tough
C/E              G
I told a lie and she got mad
Am                    G/B        C
She wasn't there when things got bad

C                    G
I never ever saw the northern lights
Am                      F
I never really heard of cluster flies
C                  G
Never ever saw the stars so bright
Am                           F    C
In the farmhouse things will be alright

{c: Repeat chorus}
{c: Solo: C  G  Am  F  (x4) }

Am                       G/B
Woke this morning to the stinging lash
C              F
Every man rise from the ash
C/E             G
Each betrayal begins with trust
Am         G         C
Every man returns to dust

{c: Chorus x 2 }

Welcome this is a Farmhouse
