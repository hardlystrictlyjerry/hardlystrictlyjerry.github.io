I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone.
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone.
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms.

Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest.
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest.
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West.

{c: Chorus}

{c: Lead}

The Sun will shine in my back door someday.
The Sun will shine in my back door someday.
March winds will blow all my troubles away.

I wish I was a headlight, on a North bound train.
I wish I was a headlight, on a North bound train.
I'd shine my light through cool Colorado rain.

{c: Chorus}

{c: Lead}

I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone.
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone.
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms.
