Beats: Ballad 8, 125 bpm

Verse: D G D F C

(Intro: 2x)

Black water and a feast in the summer,
Slow dancing with the trees all around.
I'm spinning in the breeze with my Mary-Ann,
I'd like to see her when the sun goes down.

G / F  / D
One day, maybe Tuesday evening,
I'm dancing with the trees all around,
One day and the spin slows down.

Break: D G D F C

Slow colors as we lift through the canopy,
Still laughing with her hair all around,
I'm spinning through the trees with my Mary-Ann,
Flipped over and we drift on down.

One day, maybe Tuesday evening,
She comes running when her baby comes round,
One day and when the beat slows down.
I'm dancing with the trees all around.
C                    Bb
One day and when the beat slows down.

D G D F C
One day (and I can feel it all around), one day and the beat slow down.
One day (I can see it somehow), one day and and the beat slows down


V2: D Bb F C G
Rose water is my drink in the summer
I love to see her with her hair hangin' down
Slow dancin' in the trees with my Mary Ann
She comes running when her baby comes round

Back to: D G D F C
One day, one day, when the beats slow down
One day, one day when the beat slows down

(Lead 4x: D Bb F C G)

(Acapella)
Black water and a feast in the summer,
Slow dancing with the trees all around.

D G D F C
One day, one day when the beat slows down
One day, one day when the beat slows down

(Lead, 4x E C G D A)

One day, one day when the beat slows down
One day, one day when the beat slows down

Outro E-C-G-D-A  (x 8)
