{t:Going Down the Road Feeling Bad}
{st:Woody Guthrie}

Goin' down the road feelin' bad. (x3)
I don't want to be treated this away.

Goin' where the climate suits my clothes. (x3)
I don't want to be treated this away.

(Chorus)

Goin' where the water tastes like wine. (x3)
I don't want to be treated this away.

(Chorus)

Goin' where the chilly winds don't blow. (x3)
I don't want to be treated this away.
