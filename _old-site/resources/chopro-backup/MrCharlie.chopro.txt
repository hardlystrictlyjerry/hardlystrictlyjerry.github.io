I take a little powder, take a little salt, put it in my shotgun, I go walkin' out
Jubba jubba, wolly bully, looking high, looking low,
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya, Mister Charlie told me so.

I won't even take your life, won't even take a limb,
Just unload my shotgun, take a little skin.
Jubba jubba, wolly bully, looking high, looking low,
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya, Mister Charlie told me so.

{c: |: C C# D :| D D# E}

Well you take my silver dollar, take those silver dimes,
Fix it up together in some alligator wine.
 
I can hear the drums, voodoo all night long,
Mister Charlie tells me I can't do nothing wrong.
Jubba jubba, wolly bully, looking high, looking low,
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya, Mister Charlie told me so.

Now Mister Charlie told me, won't you like to know,
Give you little warning before I let you go.
Jubba jubba, wolly bully, looking high, looking low,
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya, Mister Charlie told me so.
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya, Mister Charlie, Mister Charlie told me so.
