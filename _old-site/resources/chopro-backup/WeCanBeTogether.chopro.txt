We can be together, ahh you and me
We should be together

We are all outlaws in the eyes of America
In order to survive we steal, cheat, lie, forge, fuck, hide, and deal
We are obscene, lawless, hideous, dangerous, dirty, violent, and young

We should be together
Come on all you people standing around
Our life's too fine to let it die
We should be together

All your private property is target for your enemy
And your enemy is we

We are forces of chaos and anarchy
Everything they say we are, we are
And we are very proud of ourselves

Up against the wall
Up against the wall, motherfuckers
Tear down the wall
Tear down the wall

Come on now together
Get it on together
Everybody together

We should be together
We should be together my friends
We can be together, we will be

We must begin here and now
A new continent of earth and fire
Tear down the wall
Tear down, getting higher and higher
Tear down the wall
Tear down the wall
Tear down the wall
Wont you try?
