{c: Note: Originally in the key of B, this is in A}

{c: A | C | G | F | E }

Time to get out, I paid my dues
I need to shout there's no time to lose
No more to give, the well is dry
The pavement's warm, my brain is fried
It's time to get out, I paid my dues

My shoes have holes, my socks are bare
The mirror's secret is I'm losing my hair
I'm in prison without a crime
The sentence stretches out undefined
It's time to get out, I paid my dues, I paid my dues

{c: A | G | D  (use this for remainder of tune)}
Everything's right, so just hold tight (x7)
Everything's right, so just hold tight, just hold tight,

Going downhill with increasing speed
Compassion gives way if you listen to greed
Focus on the past and that's what will last
Nothing that is real and nothing you can feel

Focus on tomorrow you'll have to borrow
Images and mind and thoughts you left behind
Focus on today, you'll find a way
Happiness is how rooting in the now

{c: Chorus}

Look into the eyes of everyone you meet
Try not to step on your best friend's feet
The line is in the sand, the flag is planted,
The rest of your life don't take it for granted

{c: Chorus}

This world, this world, this crazy world I know
It turns, it turns, and the long night's over and the sun's coming up
{c: Repeat x 4, then "Yeah Yeah Yeah..." x 4}
{c: Solo}
