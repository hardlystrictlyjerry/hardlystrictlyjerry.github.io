{t:More (no chords)}
{st:Phish}
 
Life in slow motion, feet are in the clay
I'm going nowhere, been standing here all day
I had a notion, there was something more to do
As I watched the water, from the banks of the river it swelled and grew
And I tilt to the left, lean to the right
tilt to the left and lean to the right
Walked on coal and slept on glass, amid swords of sound and daggers of light
And my heart is screaming,
cause half of what I say is lies, and it takes so much to keep up this disguise
                   It takes so much to keep up this disguise

I see a doorway in the haze and I'm trying to get to it
The stars are peepholes in a wall but we can walk through it
The memory is still so real, the memory's still so real
I guess it's never really over even when it's over

But I'm vibrating with love and light, pulsating with love and light
in a world gone mad, a world gone mad, there must be something more than this
I'm vibrating with love and light, pulsating with love and light
in a world gone mad, a world gone mad, there must be something more than this

The trumpet call is sounding, the trees are bending low
There's a great fire in the distance, there must be something more than this
And our shadows will all be dancing, with red dust on our clothes
And we'll leave by tornado, elbows in the clouds and feet in the sky

(Chorus)

Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh, woah ohhh ohh ohh ohhh ohhh
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh, woah ohhh ohh ohh ohhh ohhh

(Chorus)
