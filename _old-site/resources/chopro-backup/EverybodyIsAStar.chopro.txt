{t:Everybody is a Star}
{st:Sly and the Family Stone}

[A]Everybody is a [G#m]star [G]who can rain and [D]chase the [A]dust away
Everybody wants to shine but who will come out on a cloudy day?

Until the sun that loves you round when the system tries to bring you down.
[A]Ever had to [G#m7]shine at night? [G]You don't need darkness to [D]do what you think is [E]right. 

[B]Ba pa-pa-pa ba pa-pa ba ba [Bb7]ba pa-pa ba pa-pa ba pa-pa ba 
[Ebm]ba ba ba-pa ba-pa ba ba ba ba , [F#]ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ba pa-pa-pa ba pa-pa ba ba ba pa-pa ba pa-pa ba pa-pa ba ba ba, 
ba-pa ba-pa ba ba ba ba

{c: Transition: E7, C#m7, A}

Everybody is a star I can feel it when you shine on me
I love you for who you are, not the one you feel you need to be
Ever catch a falling star, ain't no stopping 'til it's in the ground
Everybody is a star, one big circle going round and round
