{t:Cold Rain and Snow}
{st:Grateful Dead}

{c: ||: D    E    :||}

Well I married me a wife, she's been trouble all my life
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow, run me out in the cold rain and snow

{c: 4x instrumental}

Well she's coming down the stairs, combin' back her yellow hair
And I ain't goin be treated this old way
This old way, And I ain't goin be treated this old way.

{c: Lead, 4x instrumental}

Well she went up to her room and she sang a faithful tune
Well I'm going where those chilly winds don't blow
Winds don't blow, going where those chilly winds don't blow.

{c: 4x instrumental}

Well I married me a wife, she's been trouble all my life
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow, run me out in the cold rain and snow

Run me out in the cold rain and snow (4x)
