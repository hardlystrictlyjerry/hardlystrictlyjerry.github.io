{t:Shakedown Street}
{st:Grateful Dead}

You tell me this town ain't got no heart
The sunny side of the street is dark
Maybe that's cause it's midnight,
In the dark of the moon besides.
Maybe the dark is from your eyes (x3)
You know you got such dark eyes!

Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart.
You just gotta poke around.

You think you've seen this town clear through
Nothin' here that could interest you
It's not because you missed out
On the thing that we had to start.
Maybe you had too much too fast (x3)
Or just over played your part.

{c: Chorus }
{c: Short lead }

Since I'm passing your way today
I just stopped in 'cause I want to say
I recall your darkness
When it crackled like a thundercloud.
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart (x3)
When I can hear it beat out loud!
