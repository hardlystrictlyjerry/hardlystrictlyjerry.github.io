{t:They Love Each Other}
{st:Grateful Dead}

Mary run around, sailin' up and down,
Looking for a show in some direction.
Got it from the top, it's nothing you can stop,
Lord, you know they made a fine connection. They love each other,

Lord you can see that it's true (x3)

He could pass his time, around some other line
But you know he chose this place beside her.
Don't get in their way, there's nothing you can say,
Nothing thay you need to add or do. They love each other.

It's nothing they explain, it's like a diesel train
You better not be there when it rolls over.
And when that train rolls in you don't know where it's been,
You gotta try and see a little further. They love each other.
