Am /// | B7 E7+9 | Am

I'm looking for a chateau, 21 rooms but one will do
I'm looking for a chateau, 21 rooms but one will do
I don't want to buy it
I just want to rent it for a minute or two

I met an old mistake walking down the street today
I met an old mistake walking down the street today
I didn't want to be mean about it
But I didn't have one good word to say.

West L.A. fadeaway,
West L.A. fadeaway
Big red lite on the highway,
Little green lite on the freeway.

(Lead)

Got a steady job moving items for the mob
Got a steady job moving items for the mob
You know the pay was pathetic
It's a shame those boys couldn't be more copasetic

I need a West L.A. girl, already know what I need to know
I need a West L.A. girl, already know what I need to know
Name, address, and phone number
Lord, and just how far to go.

(Chorus)

(Lead)

(Verse 1, Chorus, "Little red light..." x 3 to end)
