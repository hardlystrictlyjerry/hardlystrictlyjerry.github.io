There's mosquitoes on the river, fish are rising up like birds
It's been hot for seven weeks now, too hot to even speak now, 
Did you hear what I just heard?

Say it might have been a fiddle or it could have been the wind
But there seems to be a beat now I can feel it my feet now, listen here it comes again!

There's a band out on the highway, they're high steppin' into town
It's a rainbow full of sound, it's fireworks, calliopes and clowns.  Everybody dancin' 

{c: | A6 Dm F#m7 D#o7| Dm F#m7 D7 E | A6 Dm F#m7 D#o7 | D / E / |}
C'mon children, C'mon children, C'mon on clap your hands.

Sun went down in honey and the moon came up in wine,
You know stars were spinnin' dizzy the band kept us too busy. 
We forgot about the time.

They're a band beyond description, like Jehovah's favorite choir.
People joining hand in hand while the music played the band.  
Lord, they're setting us on fire.

Crazy rooster crowin’ midnight, balls of lightin' roll along
Old men sing about their dreams, women laugh and children scream, 
And the band keeps playin' on.

Keep on dancin' thru the daylight, greet the morning air with song
No ones's noticed, but the band's all pack and gone.  
Were they ever here at all?   But they keep on dancin' 
C'mon children, C'mon children, C'mon clap your hands

Well the cool breeze came on Tuesday, and the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancin' full of singin' and romancin', 
The music never stopped!
