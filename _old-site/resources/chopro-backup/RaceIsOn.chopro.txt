{t: The Race Is On}
{st: Grateful Dead}

I feel tears welling up from down deep inside
Like my heart's got a big break.
And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful
That I may never shake.
You might think that I'm taking it hard
Since you broke me off with a call.
You might wager that I'll hide in sorrow
and I might lay right down and bawl.

Now the race is on and here comes pride up the back stretch.
Heartaches a goin' to the inside,
My tears are holding back, tryin' not to fall.
My heart's our of the running
True love scratched for another's sake.
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all.

One day I ventured in love never once suspecting
What the final result would be.
Now I live in fear of wakin up each morning and
Finding that you're gone from me
There's an aching pain in my heart for the name
Of the one that I hated to face.
Someone else came out to win her
And I came out in second place.
