My time coming, anyday, don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way, I'm in no hurry, no
Rainbows end down that highway where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, voices saying they tell me where to go.
Don't worry about me, nah nah nah, don't worry about me, no
and I'm in no hurry, nah nah nah, I know where to go.

(California) Preaching on the burning shore.
(California) I'll be knocking on the golden door
(Like an angel) standing in a shaft of light
(Rising up to paradise) I know I'm gonna shine.

My time coming, anyday, don't worry about me, no
It's gonna be just like they say, them voices tell me so
Seems so long I felt this way and time sure passin' slow
Still I know I lead the way, they tell me where I go.
Don't worry about me, no no no, don't worry about me, no
and I'm in no hurry, no no no, I know where to go.

You've all been asleep, you would not believe me (Oooooh)
Them voices tellin' me, you will soon receive me (Ooooooh)
Standin' on the beach, the sea will part before me 
(Fire wheel burning in the air!)
You will follow me and we will ride to glory 
(way up, the middle of the air!)

{c: ||: Dm    E7    :||}

And I'll call down thunder and speak the same. My work fills the sky with flame
Might and glory gonna be my name. Men gonna light my way.
