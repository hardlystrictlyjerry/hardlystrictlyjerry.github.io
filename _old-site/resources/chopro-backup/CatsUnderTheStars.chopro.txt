Cats on the blacktop, birdie in the treetop, Someone plays guitar that sounds like clarinet
I ain't ready yet to go to bed, I think I'll take a walk downtown instead.

{c: Chorus}

Cats on the bandstand, Give'em each a big hand, Anyone who sweats like that must be all right
No one wants to fight; no blackeye, Just another cat beneath the stars tonight

{c: Chorus}

Cats in the limelight, feels like it's alright, Everybody wants something they might not get
I ain't ready yet, it ain't complete, That's why I am headin' down to Alleycat Street.

{c: Chorus, followed by G major climb, followed by A major climb}

Satin blouse unbuttoning, satin blouse unbuttoning

Time is a stripper's doin', it's just for you
Time is a stripper's doin', it's just for you

Nail in the brass tacks, cover up your tracks Jack
You ain't nowhere till you can pay your own way back
What else do you lack to make it right?
Cats down under the stars tonight?

{c: Chorus}
