{t:Beware of Darkness}
{st:George Harrison}

{c: Intro: B  B/A   G7}

[G7]Watch out now, take care beware of [G#]falling [C#m]swingers [A]
[A]Dropping all [E]around you [C#m] [G#m]
[G#m]The pain that often [C#m]mingles in your [Dsus2]fingertips[A], beware of [B]darkness

Watch out now, take care beware of thoughts that linger
Winding up inside your head
The hopelessness around you in the dead of night, beware of sadness

[B]It can [E]hit you, it can [D]hurt you
[A]Make you [F#m]sore and what is [Bm]more, that is [G7]not what you are [B]here for

Watch out now, take care beware of soft shoe shufflers
Dancing down the sidewalks
As each unconscious sufferer wanders aimlessly, beware of maya

{c: Lead: E  D  A  F#m  Bm  G7  B   B/A  G7}

Watch out now, take care beware of greedy leaders
They'll take you where you should not go
While weeping atlas cedars, they just want to grow, grow and grow
Beware of darkness (beware of darkness)
