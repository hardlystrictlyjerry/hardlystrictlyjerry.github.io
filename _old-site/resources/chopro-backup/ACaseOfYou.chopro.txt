{t:A case of you}
{st:Joni Mitchell}
 
[C]Just before our love [G/B]got lost you said
[Am7]"I am as constant as a northern star"
[Am7]And I said, "Const[Dm]antly in the [C]darkness 
[C]Where's that at?  [G/B]
[Am7]If you want me I'll be in the [G]bar" 

On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada, oh [C]Ca  -  [C/B]na  -  [Am7]da
With your [Dm]face [C]sketched on it [G/B]twice 
 
{soc:}
Oh, [F]you’re in my blood like holy wine [Em]
[Dm]You taste so bitter and so [C]sweet 
Oh [C]I could drink a case of [C/B]you   [Am7]and
[Dm]Still [C]I'd be on my [G/B]feet
I'd still be on my feet 
{eoc:}
 
Oh I am a lonely painter, I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil, and I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid

I remember that time that you told me, you said
"Love is touching souls", surely you touched mine
’Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time 

I met a woman, she had a mouth like yours
She knew your life, she knew your devils and your deeds 
And she said  "Go to him, stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed"
