{t:To Lay Me Down}
{st:Grateful Dead}

[G]To lay me [Em]down, once [C]more, To lay me [G]down 
[G]With my [Bm]head [A]in sparkling [E]clover
[G]Let the world go [D]by, [Am]like the clouds [C]a'streamin'
[C]To lay me [G]down, [F]one last time, [C]to lay me [G]down

{C: Chorus}

[G]To lay me [Bm]down, [Am]to lay me [D]down, 
[C]To lay me [G]down, [F]one last [C]time, to lay me [G]down

To be with you, once more, to be with you.
With our bodies entwined together
Let the world go by, all lost in dreaming
To lay me down, one last time, to lay me down

To lie with you, once more, to lie with you
With our dreams close together
To wake beside you, my love still sleeping
To tell sweet lies, one last time and say good night
