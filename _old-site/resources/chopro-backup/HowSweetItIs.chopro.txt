How sweet it is to be loved by you

Open my eyes at night, I wonder what I would be without you in my life
Everything was just a bore, all the things I've done, I've done them before
But you brightened up all of my days
With your love so sweet and in so many ways

I want to stop - to thank you baby
I want to stop - to thank you baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

Sweeter than the honey from the bees, baby
