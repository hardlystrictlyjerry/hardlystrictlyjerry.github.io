## Basic principles

After reviewing six articles on setlist design (links below), I have found there are only a handful of generally accepted heuristics, which can be summarized as follows:

* Do not play more than two songs in a row in the same key signature.
* Do not play more than two songs in a row at the same general tempo (i.e. 60-80 bpm, 80-112 bpm, 112+ bpm)
* Open and close each set with a strong song.
* Know the length of the songs, so you can calculate the length of the set.
* Consider prior setlists, avoid too much repetition.

## Tips for HSJ setlist design

**Avoid more than two songs in a row in the same key.**  The [HSJ Master Jam Notes Page](http://bit.ly/2MK4Y55) contains the key signature associated with all of the songs we have previously played.

**Incorporate slow songs judiciously.** Eventually, the Master Jam Notes will contain tempo information as well. For now, just use your own judgement:  Alabama Getaway = Fast; Candyman = Slow, etc.  

**Open and close each set with a strong song.**  At the September 2018 jam, Philip decided to open the second set with Dear Prudence, and John Stallings literally yelled his displeasure into the recording mic.

**Plan for 6-8 songs per set**  I believe Paul uses 6 minutes per song as a general rule for determining how long a set will last.

**Use HSJ setlist history to avoid overplaying songs.**  The [Setlists Page](setlists.html) contains the historical record. In general, if we've played the same song the last two gigs, we probably want to give it a rest.

**Consider 1-2 brand new songs.** The [Dead Songbook](resources/deadr5v4.pdf) contains most of the Dead's repertoire (200+ songs). Consult this for breakout song ideas. We like trying out a small number of new songs.  

**Check online setlist databases to see what songs came before and after a given song.**  [SetLists.net](https://www.setlists.net/) and [DeadLists.net](http://www.deadlists.com/default.asp) enable you to retrieve links to all the shows where the Dead played a particular song (or group of songs). If you're wondering what the Dead typically played after Estimated Prophet (answer: Eyes of the World), you can get a sense for that at these sites.

## What did the Dead do?

It is interesting to look at some common song couplets:

**China -> Rider**. China Cat Sunflower is in G, and IKYR is in D.  As D is the V chord for the key of G, it is easy to make this segue from a harmonic standpoint.  Also, the tempo and rhythm change as part of the transition into IKYR, making this an interesting song sequence.

**Scarlet -> Fire**.  Scarlet Begonias is in E, and Fire on the Mountain is in B.  Once again, B is the V chord for the key of E, making the segue easy harmonically. The tempo and rhythm for these two songs are not very different, however.

**Throwing Stones -> NFA -> GDTRFB**.  All three of these songs are in the key of E!  However, the tempo (and particularly the rhythmic feel) change dramatically throughout the three songs.

**Estimated -> Eyes**. Estimated Prophet is in F#m, and in 7/4 time, while Eyes is in E and a standard 4/4 time. Generally, Eyes will have a faster tempo.

**Lazy Lightning -> Supplication**. Have these songs ever not been played together? Anyway, Lazy Lightning is in C, Supplication is in D.

**Althea -> Valerie**. Just kidding! I provide this couplet to illustrate that certain songs are way too similar to appear in the same setlist, much less right next to each other.  Another example of an "anti-couplet" is Ramble on Rose and Brown-eyed Women.

Let's now look at a couple of Dead sets to see these principles in action:

### 5/8/77, set 1

* Minglewood Blues (E, up tempo)
* Loser (Am, slow, minor)
* El Paso (D, up tempo)
* TLEO (G, midtempo)
* Jack Straw (E, midtempo)
* Deal (A, midtempo)
* Lazy Lightning -> Supplication (C, D, uptempo)
* Brown-eyed Women (E, midtempo)
* Mama Tried(D, uptempo)
* Row Jimmy (A, slow)

(Strange to end the set with Row Jimmy, but otherwise a nice variety and flow)

### 9/18/87, set 2

* Shakedown Street (G, midtempo)
* Women are smarter (E, midtempo)
* Terrapin Station (G -> D, midtempo)
* Drums
* GDTRFB (E, uptempo)
* All along the watchtower (Bm, uptempo)
* Morning Dew (D, slow)
* Good Lovin' (C, uptempo)
