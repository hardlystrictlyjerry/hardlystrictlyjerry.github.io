<h1><img class="ui avatar image" src="/images/jerryavatar.jpg">February 2017</h1>

Thanks to Kevin and Heidi for sponsoring an epic Hardly Strictly Jerry Jam!  You'll have to take my word for the epicness, because the only record of the jam is in the memories of those who attended. (Actually, the party obliterated a few of the memories for a few of us...) 

Songs included: Friend of the Devil, He's Gone, Terrapin, Sugar Mag, Positively 4th Street, When I paint my masterpiece, Cassidy, New Speedway Boogie, Queen Jane, Saint Stephen, Not Fade Away -> Saint Stephen, Tennessee Jed, Uncle John's Band.

Several new songs at this jam, and less than the usual number of train wrecks.
