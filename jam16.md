# Setlist selection

Here's a list of the setlists from the last two jams plus this upcoming Saturday. I feel a top priority is for everyone to be able to get one or two of their favorites into the setlist. So, please come prepared to indicate a couple of songs you'd like us to play. That should generate around a dozen "high priority" songs which we can augment with others to round out the gig. We can figure out the setlist order, who sings what, etc. later.
