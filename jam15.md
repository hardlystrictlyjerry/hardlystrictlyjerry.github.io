<h2>Directions to Paul's Studio</h2>

In a nutshell, you will:

  * Temporarily park in an alley just a few steps from the studio entrance for load-in/load-out.
  * Call Paul at [808-228-6066‬](tel:808-228-6066‬) when you have parked in alley and are about to drop off equipment. Studio is on second floor so you will probably drop off equipment on ground floor with someone to watch it, then repark car.
  * Park in public parking a block away during the jam.
