title: "Next Door"
---

We started off June with a gig at a new venue: Next Door in Chinatown. The bar is a nice place for music, but we were unfortunately in the situation of training a novice sound person. It was super fun regardless. 

Set One: Cold Rain and Snow, Boogie On Reggae Woman, Second that Emotion, Back on the Train, Bug, Quinn the Eskimo, Tore Up Over You, Evangeline, Let it rock, Midnight Moonlight.

Set Two: Brown Eyed Women, Everything's Right, After Midnight, Mystery Train, Meet de boys on the battlefront, China Cat Sunflower, I know you rider, Wolfman's Brother, Just One More, Possum

Encore: Lonesome and a long way from home
