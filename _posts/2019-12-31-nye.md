It was the NYE party that almost wasn't!  Heidi came back from her trip with pneumonia, and so with two days to go, Kevin had to find a new location or cancel the party.  Fortunately, Candis Burton kindly stepped up and offered her farm in Waimanalo. HSJ hosted a surprise marriage proposal for the second time. This is apparently going to be a thing.
