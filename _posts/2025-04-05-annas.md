HSJ returned to Anna's for the first time in.... five years? We were trying out a new sound person (Tommy), new songs (Music Never Stopped, Shamalama), and new equipment (in ear monitors for Philip, a new 9V battery for Kevin's bass).

The results were better than expected on all fronts. 

Set 1: Bertha, Tore Up Over You, Franklin's Tower, Second that Emotion, No Raindrops, Women are Smarter, Ramble On Rose, Hungersite, Deal

Set 2: Music Never Stopped, Midnight Moonlight, Dear Mr. Fantasy, Apocalypse Babe, Free, Quinn the Eskimo, Shamalama, Everything's Right

Encore: One More Saturday Night
