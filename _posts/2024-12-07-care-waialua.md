title: "Care Waialua"
---

Care Waialua is a weed farm on the North Shore, and for this gig Matt flexed his promotional skills to include poster design, instagram marketing, and ticket vending via EventBrite. The results exceeded expectations: almost 200 people came to the show and we had a packed dance floor from start to end.  

Hardly Strictly Jerry shared the bill with Dark Side of the Beach, a new Pink Floyd tribute band (that also featured current and former members of HSJ). 

The on-stage sound left a lot to be desired, but what else is new. 

Setlist: How sweet it is, Shakedown Street, West LA Fadeaway, No Raindrops, Sugaree, Deal, Hard to Handle, Blaze On, China Cat Sunflower, Free, I know you rider, Possum, One More Saturday Night, After midnight.
