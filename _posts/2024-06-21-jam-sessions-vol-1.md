title: "Jam Sessions, Volume 1"
---

Matt is an Ideas Guy. This gig arose from his vision of a regular "jam night" with a rotating cast of local musicians who can "stretch out". There were two opening acts, then we did a single set.  And stretch out we did!

Setlist: White Room, Stir it up, Hard to Handle, Hungersite, Shelter, Down by the river, Blaze On, Meet de boys on the battlefront.
