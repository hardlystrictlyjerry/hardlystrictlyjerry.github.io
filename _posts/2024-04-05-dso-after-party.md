Dark Star Orchestra announced two shows at the Hawaii Theater, and Matt had a vision: a late night after party! He booked the gig and it was on.

We played from about 11:00pm to 1:30am at Proof Social Club in Chinatown, about one block from the Hawaii Theater.

Matt was very confident that we'd have a good turnout, and he was right:
