<h1><img class="ui avatar image" src="/images/hsj-circle-logo.png">Sunshine Family Farm Fundraiser, Year Two</h1>

Our thanks to Kiki and Tim for having us as the band for their second annual Sunshine Family Farm fundraiser. 

On the positive side, there was a large and enthusiastic crowd, and Kevin Hughes (KH7) outdid himself with a rear-projected light show that covered the entire stage.  

On the negative side, Philip was battling an illness and so there were a number of last minute adjustments. Thank you for helping me get through the gig.
