The votes are in and here are the results of polling for the HSJ Core Repertoire. It turned out that a reasonable decision criteria was to exclude any songs that received two or more "Prefer not" votes, which leaves us with 39 songs: more or less enough for around four sets without repeats.

Here are the songs:

## Winners

Six songs that were unanimously voted into the CR: Althea, Cassidy, Eyes, Jack Straw, Shakedown, Tennessee Jed

## Runners up

Thirteen songs got 5 out of 6 votes: After Midnight, China Rider, Good Lovin, Lonesome and a long way from home, Mississippi Half Step, Morning Dew, Quinne, Scarlet-Fire, Sugar Mag, Sugaree, TLEO, Truckin, West LA

## The rest of the pack

These songs received less votes than the above, but no more than one "prefer not": Alabama Getaway, Big Railroad Blues, Blaze On, Brown Eyed Women, Candyman, Casey Jones, Cold Rain and Snow, GDTRFB, Golden Road, Loose Lucy, New Speedway, NFA, Peggy O, Ramble on Rose, Samson and Delilah, One more Sat Night, Second that emotion, Terrapin, US Blues, Valerie
