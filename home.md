Jerry Garcia played many different styles &mdash; rock, jazz, fusion, gospel, soul, Motown, bluegrass, funk, and folk &mdash; sometimes combining a few within the same tune! It's fun to play Jerry's music in part because of this lack of stylistic limitation.

In this mostly monthly musical gathering, we play the music that Jerry wrote, the music that Jerry covered, and even the music that we think Jerry might have liked had he been around to hear it.

Each HSJ jam has a host.  The host decides on the time and place of the jam, the invitation list, and any ground rules (kid friendly or not, potluck, electric, acoustic, etc.) The host provides a startup setlist of songs to get things started, though where we end up is anyone's guess.

Do you like Jerry's music? Do you sing, play guitar, drums, bass, keyboards, flute, harmonica, didgeridoo, etc? Email <a href="mailto:hardlystrictlyjerry@gmail.com">hardlystrictlyjerry@gmail.com</a> for more information.
