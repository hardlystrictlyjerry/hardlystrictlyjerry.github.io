## Jason's email (6/10/22)

Schedule:
* Doors at 3
* 3:30 - 4:14 opening acoustic bluegrass The Other Ones
* 4:30 - 6  hardly strictly
* 6:30 - 8:30 ingles

Planning to arrive between noon and 1 to setup.   You guys are sharing drums so that's cool; please be ready to soundcheck around 2.

Speakers - I've got my usual qsc setup.  2 x 12 mains, there will be a subwoofer (thanks tim).  If someone wants to bring additional speakers to cover the space better, we can chain them off the mains easily enough but you'll need stands.

The stage is not huge.   I'm gonna set up 3 monitors - stage left, stage right, and drummer.  There's really not room for more on stage.

The stage was only covered by a tent that covered exactly the stage size last time; if it rains wind will blow it on stage.  It's also quite dusty out there if it's dry and the sun beats down.  Consider stuff to cover your gear when not in use like a sheet or tarp. (Editor's note: The stage will be bigger since Tim will set up KH's 20x20.)

Microphones - I've got plenty.  However if you want to use a particular mic let me know and we can see if we can make it work.

I have 16 inputs, HSJ will use them all; additional drum tracks when the 16 are full to be provided by a drum submix that Steve Howells will set up.

## Kiki's email announcement (5/30/22)

Exciting announcement!

We have just added a third band to the line up! Like Jerry’s banjo beginnings, it will be bluegrass style grateful tunes starting at 3:15 so don’t be late!

Doors open at 3; Music starts shortly after.

Thank you for joining us for the most joyous afternoon ever! Get ready to be grateful!  Sat. June 18, 3pm

But first, here’s how to get there!

Sunshine Family Farm is an off grid farm tucked in the mountains of Mokuleia, behind Dillingham Airfield.
It’s at the end of a winding dirt road so be sure to arrive with plenty of splintered sunlight! (or a long strange trip it shall be!)

68-670 Farrington Hwy

Turn onto the dirt road and follow to the end 1.5 miles. Road turns right and left but just keep coming down. Follow arrows and signs. There’s 2 gates before our spot.

Code 0618, SEND.  (for both gates)

Come through the gate and follow to the end. We are at the very end on the left. Park only on left hand side of the road.

Please be courteous as you pass through neighboring farmland, as it is all private property.

It’s beautiful but raw land, so be prepared to be in the elements. Suncoverage, natural bug spray, water bottles. Bring a beach blanket or beach chairs. No dogs.

Food and beverage for sale. (Vegan)

Conscious Event: No alcohol.

Doors open at 3pm. Music starts at 3:15. 
  * Opening grateful bluegrass band. 
  * 2 Headlining amazing electric bands specializing in paying tribute to the greatest songs on earth! The setlists are to die for! You don’t wanna miss any of it!  Come early, dance your face off!

Private event. Farm fundraiser, not for profit. Share ticket link with friends, but do not share location because it is presale only, no doorsales day of.

We are so grateful to come together in community and rejoice and share our love of music and nature with you!

Much love, Tim, Kiki, and the Sunshine Family Farm
