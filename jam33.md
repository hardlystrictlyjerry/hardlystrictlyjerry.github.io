<div class="ui embed" data-source="youtube" data-id="eLiSf5H6rUU"></div>

Our friends Kiki and Tim invited us to play along with two other bands at an all-Dead jamboree at their farm on the North Shore.  We played one set and had a blast. And much of the fun can be directly attributed to Matt Vazzano, who has joined us on keyboards.  

Setlist: Shakedown Street, They Love Each Other, Sugaree, Peggy-O, Valerie, Tennessee Jed, Golden Road to Unlimited Devotion, Terrapin Station > Morning Dew, One More Saturday Night
