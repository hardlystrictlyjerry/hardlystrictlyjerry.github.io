Jerry Garcia played many different styles &mdash; folk, bluegrass, rock, reggae, jazz, country &mdash; sometimes all within the same tune! It's fun to play Jerry's music in part because of this lack of stylistic limitation.

In this mostly monthly musical gathering, we'll play the music that Jerry wrote, the music that Jerry covered, and even the music that we think Jerry might have liked had he been around to hear it.

Each HSJ jam has a host.  The host decides on the time and place of the jam, and any ground rules (kid friendly or not, potluck, electric, acoustic, etc.) The host can provide a "kickoff setlist" of a half dozen or so songs to get things started, though where we end up is anyone's guess.

Do you like Jerry's music? Do you sing, play guitar, drums, bass, keyboards, flute, harmonica, didgeridoo, etc? Email <a href="mailto:hardlystrictlyjerry@gmail.com">hardlystrictlyjerry@gmail.com</a> for details on the next gathering.
